      " Maximal exercise was attempted:  suboptimal heart rate, but adequate peak pressure-rate product were attained.  A hypertensive response to exercise occurred.  The stress electrocardiogram demonstrated evidence compatible with myocardial ischemia.  Borderline-abnormal myocardial perfusion scintigraphy with evidence suggestive of exercise induced reversible myocardial ischemia in the usual distribution of the right coronary artery, but without definite evidence for myocardial infarction. Diaphragmatic attenuation of the inferior wall was present.  Chest wall attenuation was evident in the images.  Gated perfusion images demonstrated normal LV size with low-normal systolic performance, and with normal peak diastolic filling rate.  Regional function analysis at rest revealed normal wall motion.  This mild perfusion abnormality may reflect poor regional coronary flow reserve, and is not likely to be due to a critical arterial stenosis.  However, a repeat study (at 12 to 24 months) may be useful.

      "Appearance of post-radiation change in the upper thoracic spine.  Correlate with patient history. Increased activity in the sternoclavicular joint and right first rib and right lumbar spine , which are most consistent           with DJD, but cannot definitively exclude metastatic involvement.  Correlate further with plain radiographs. Activity in the right costal cartilage consistent with old trauma. Visualization of the right ureter, possibly consistent with distal obstruction in the urinary collecting system.                     Recommend further evaluation with ultrasound exam to rule out hydroureter. No scintigraphic evidence to suggest widespread foci of activity characteristic of metastatic disease.     0\n",

      "  Several ill defined, nonspecific pulmonary nodules bilaterally, none typical of metastasis but the most \"metastasis-like\" is in the lateral segment of the right middle lobe abutting the pleura (series 3, image 31) and measures approximately 8 mm in diameter.  Other lesions on the right are smaller and less distinct (for example, image 28, 33, 34, and 38; and on the left, images 34 and 42). Less \"nodular\" opacities, in some areas accompanied by linear scarring or adhesion atelectasis, particularly in the left lower lobe, are present elsewhere bilaterally and it may be that the metastasis-like abnormalities are also due to aspirate.  No conclusive evidence of intrathoracic or abdominal metastasis.  Normal heart size.          0\n",

      "  The \"nodules\" that were present previously, even the most suspicious one in the middle lobe, have resolved except for one inhomogeneous opacity in the lateral basal segment of the left lower lobe that appears larger than it did previously (images 49-52) morphologically atypical for a metastasis and more compatible with aspirate or infection.  No evidence of intrathoracic lymphadenopathy.  Heart size normal.  There may be a very small and localized calcified plaque in the proximal LAD though this appearance could be produced by summation artifact.  No evidence of intra-abdominal metastasis.          0\n"
