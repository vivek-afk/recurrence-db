The patient presents to the head and neck medical oncology clinic for an initial consultation and for further management of his disease. Please allow us to review the patient's history for our records. In the summer of 2007, he had increased problems with his sinuses and he was diagnosed with osteomyelitis and a sinus infection. He was placed on antibiotics and he began to heal over time. A biopsy was done in August of that summer that showed a tumor involving the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses in the nasal cavities. The pathology on the tumor was invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. On imaging, the tumor involved the lacrimal sac, the medial orbit extending into the orbital contents invading clinically the extraocular muscles and extending into the skin in the region of the medial canthus. He received induction chemotherapy with cisplatin, docetaxel, 5-FU. On this chemotherapy he had tumor progression. In January 2008, he received concomitant chemotherapy and radiation with Taxol, 5-FU, hydroxyurea, and radiation therapy. He completed 2 out of 7 rounds of chemotherapy and was lost to followup. Complications of his treatment include some skin toxicity grade 1 and mucosis toxicity grade 1. He subsequently moved to Colorado for some amount of time, but developed pain in the area that made him concerned that his cancer was growing again. He moved back to Chicago and was seen at Rush University, where he underwent a  maxillectomy with orbital exenteration on 8/20/09 with Dr. Guy Joseph Petruzzelli with palliative intent. Since that time, he reports he has had minimal follow up for his malignancy. He remains with an open sinus - he put off being seen for a prosthesis at UIC because he was ""scared"". He finally saw them recently, and he was told that he will need a repeat surgery prior to fitting a prosthetic device. He was admitted to U of C in May 2013 for sinusitis - he was evaluated by Dr. Elizabeth Blair with a flexible endoscopy and MRI which showed no evidence of disease. He now presents to establish care again at U of C.  Currently, he states he is doing okay. He is concerned because he has developed new focal pain on the right side of his face and left maxillary sinus. He is dealing with dryness of his open sinuses and has begun using nasal saline spray with some relief. He often gets very congested with dry mucous and this causes pain as well. He denies any fevers or chills. Notably, these symptoms were similar to when he presented in 2013 and was seen by Dr. Blair. His last imaging was over a year ago.

Per Dr. Fergusons note: there was ""a conglomeration of metastatic disease posteriorly in the lower lobe, 2 isolated nodules adjacent to each other laterally in the lower lobe, additional possible pleural implants in the lower lobe, a nodule in the parenchyma near the fissure and interlobar artery, and at least 1 implant on the diaphragm. The 2 lateral nodules adjacent to each other were wedge excised in a single specimen and removed in a bag."" Pathology confirmed these to be two foci of metastatic SCC. These were not all removed. He saw Dr. Haraf today in clinic. It was discussed with patient that there is no role for local therapy in the absence of any symptoms and especially given that not all lesions are visible on imaging. Since last clinic visit, patient reports:  - Energy/Functional status: working full-time. Energy level 90%, limited by fatigue. - Pain: none, not on narcotics. Mild finger numbers, which may be due to carpel tunnel. No numbness in toes. - Nutrition: eating well. Wt stable. Denies n/v. Continues to have mouth dryness. Has no change in taste. He denies SOB, CP, diarrhea, new pain, or any other acute medical changes. ONCOLOGIC HISTORY:   April 2012: He underwent induction cetuximab/taxol/cisplatin/everolimus followed by chemoradiation (TFH with BID WOWO XRT) for T3N2b p16+ L tonsillar SCC. 3/13/13: CT chest demonstrated new right hilar lymphadenopathy, measuring 1.3 cm in short axis. 3/22/13: PET/CT demonstrated enlarged right hilar lymphadenopathy with  increased FDG uptake and maximal SUV of 7.3. A micronodule in the right perihilar region has minimal uptake. Also, mild FDG uptake is noted in a new nodular density in posterior basal segment of right lower lobe with maximal SUV of 3.2. 4/8/13: Needle aspiration of 11R inferior lymph node revealed metastatic SCC with basaloid features, p16+. A RLL subpleural nodule increased in size from 9x8 mm to 10x9 mm, a pulmonary opacity in the R posterior costophrenic angle became more confluent and suspicious for tumor, and a 5 mm subpleural nodule in the RLL was also increased in size. PET CT also showed progression of moderately hypermetabolic subpleural lesions in the RLL. 12/10/13: He was seen in re-consultation in our department with Dr. Haraf. It was discussed that the toxicity of re-irradiation of the inferior RLL lesions in the prior treatment field would outweigh the benefits and that irradiation of the more superior lesion would be of little benefit if he had other sites of metastatic disease. We recommended evaluation for surgical resection or biopsy by Dr. Ferguson. He recommended either observation with repeat CT in 3 months of VATS biopsy for diagnosis and molecular markers. Mr. Buttle opted for repeat imaging. There was, however, continued increased growth in RLL subpleural nodules. The previous 10 x 9 mm nodule now measured 14 x 12 mm and the previous 5 mm nodule now measured 7 mm. 3/12/14: He was seen in follow-up by Dr. Vokes. A referral was made again  to Dr. Ferguson to discuss biopsy/excision for Foundation Medicine. He was re-referred to our clinic for discussion of SBRT options. |2014-07-02:	He had  CT scan showing his 2 nodules increased in size from previous visit in his lungs. He otherwise feels his ""new normal"" in energy and is eating and drinking well. He denies CP, SB, n/v/d, fevers or chills. He is interested in starting his Merk trial and signed consent and is ready to start. A referral was made again to Dr. Ferguson to discuss biopsy/excision for Foundation Medicine. 7/2/17: CT with increase in size of pulmonary nodules |2014-07-11:	Started pembrolizumab / MK--3475 trial (IRB 130311) clinical trial 7/11/14. |2014-07-11:	7/11/2014: started MK--3475. |2014-07-11:	He started on pembrolizumab / MK--3475 trial (IRB 130311) clinical trial 7/11/14. |2014-07-11:	He is currently enrolled in the MK-3475 (IRB 130311) clinical trial.

In more detail, this is a 54-year-old gentleman with a history of oral tongue carcinoma with multiple recurrences and excisions. He initially presented in 1984 with oral tongue carcinoma and underwent partial glossectomy. In July 1999 and then February 2000, he developed recurrent, for which he underwent further partial glossectomies. In September of 2000, the patient developed a 6 cm left neck mass. He underwent cisplatin, 5-FU, and docetaxel chemotherapy with a partial response. In August 2003, he again had a floor of mouth recurrence invading the inner mandible. Biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. At that time, he was offered radical surgery with the potential of adjuvant re-irradiation. The patient was not interested in re-irradiation at that time. He subsequently underwent wide local excision and multiple reconstructions for his recurrent cancer. Most recently in February 2007, the patient was found to have another recurrence. Mouth resection revealed invasive squamous cell carcinoma with a positive deep margin. There was in situ carcinoma at the superior margin. Multiple biopsies were taken of the dorsal tongue flap, buccal mucosa which were negative for carcinoma. The patient subsequently underwent reexcision of the tongue and was still found to have recurrent squamous cell carcinoma present within the muscle. He then underwent  partial glossectomy and and free flap reconstruction in May 2007. In August 2009, on a regular follow-up with Dr. Stenson, another oropharyngeal lesion was noticed. A wide local excision of the right oropharyngeal lesion and of the retromolar trigone lesion revealed a right tonsil squamous cell carcinoma. Most recently he presented to Dr. Stenson with 6 week history of dysphagia and mild odynophagia on 10.25.12. CT neck on 10.29.12 showed a new centrally necrotic enhancing mass in the right paratracheal region which extended from the level of the thyroid cartilage superiorly to the level of the upper esophagus inferiorly. The mass invaded the right neck strap muscles and right lobe of the thyroid gland anteriorly and enveloped at least 180 degrees of the right common carotid artery laterally. Medially, it invaded the wall of the trachea causing luminal narrowing and cartilage destruction, although the lumen was patent. The mass was inseparable from the esophagus which was distorted in appearance with obliterated lumen suggesting direct invasion. On 11.6.12, the patient had an FNA of the neck which was positive for SCC. On 11.12.12, he underwent radical resection of the right paratracheal tumor, ligation of the internal jugular vein and flexible esophagoscopy, as well a sternocleidomastoid flap. Pathology demonstrated the following:  A. Strap muscle; excision:   - Skeletal muscle, no tumor present. B. Right thyroid mass; excision:   - Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma replacing thyroid tissue and   extending to the inked surface. - Perineural invasion present. - Three lymph nodes, no tumor present (0/3). C. Common esophageal wall; excision:   - Keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma extensively infiltrating skeletal   muscle. After review of the case on tumor board, it was decided that the patient is started on TFHX for 4.5 cycles (66Gys due to positive margins, R1  resection). He is here today for a regular follow up. He reports the following:  -dysphagia, present since surgery on 11.12.12. He finished a second course of tapering steroids yesterday (12.2.12) and he is scheduled to receive a trach and G-tube today. -neck tightness and occasional neck pain. -mild dyspnea on exertion, present since his last surgery. He otherwise reports relatively good energy levels, denies fevers/chills, and he is maintaining his weight. |2012-12-24:	/  HPI Recurrent HNC:  R paratracheal mass invading the trachea and the esophagus s/p surgical excision admitted for C1/5 TFHX    The history is provided by the patient.

The patient presents to the Head and Neck Medical Oncology Clinic for an initial consultation. Jerry Culhane is a 62 year old man with likely metastatic HPV+ SCC of right BOT. The lesion was noted to extend inferiorly into the right vallecula and base of the epiglottis and posteriorly with the oral pharyngeal wall. There was extension across midline floor of mouth and median raphae. There were also enlarged lymph node at level IIA on the right measuring 2.4 cm, with a suspicious 9 mm node inferior at level III. Initial staging NM Bone scan revealed disease confined to the oropharyngeal cavity and right neck. Due to a mild hearing dysfunction he reports is related to occupational exposure, he elected to receive definitive CRT with cetuximab and RT from 4/21/14-6/9/14. His cetuximab was initially dosed at 450 mg/m2 but was dose reduced to 250 mg/m2 due to severe mucositis and one cycle of chemotherapy was deferred due to severe mucositis. He reports that he did well initially after CRT. He had improvement in his energy level and was tolerating soft/pureed foods PO. He presented for post-treatment CT scan of the neck on 8/4/14 which showed his right tonsillar mass to be less ""clearly discernable"" and decreased size of the right level IIA lymph node. He received restaging PET scan 9/2/2014 which did not appreciate the previously identified hypermetabolic areas locate  in the right base of tongue and right cervical node. However, there was a new focus of uptake in the left tonsil with a SUV of 4.7. In addition, there was increased metabolic activity in the right yupper lobe with a SUV of 4.6 and surrounding GGO around this lesion with SUV of 2.2. As he was noting some SOB and new signs of aspiration, he was given a 7 day course of levaquin per his wife with improvement in his SOB. In early October he began to notice worsening dysphagia to both solids and liquids and increased fatigue. Around October 11th, he noticed acute onset of anterior neck swelling and reports that over the course of the month he was prescribed two Z-paks with improvement in the swelling although he does not feel his neck has returned to baseline. In addition, since that time, he has had worsening oral secretions described as thick, brownish-green in color. He is also concerned about episodes of hypotension leading to falls at home. He reports these episodes of hypotension usually occur when he is bending over to pick something up. He reports 4 non-traumatic falls over the past couple of months due to hypotension. On October 27th he had CT Chest wo and was noted to have 2-3 subcentimeter (largest reported to be 7mm) lesions in the LUL. He denies CP, SOB. No lesions were appreciated in the right lung. Overall, he feels that his functional status has declined over the past month. He notes more fatigue, feeling able to complete only 1-2 small activities per day. He continues to get in good nutrition via G tube and reports that he is maintaining stable weight, but has not returned to his pretreatment baseline weight of 185#. He is a never smoker. He has baseline hearing loss due to occupational exposures, but does not require a hearing aid.

She was undergoing her yearly surveillance with Dr. Stenson, CT scan 5 years s/p laryngectomy, and was found to have RLL lung mass and mediastinal adenopathy, not present a year prior. Subsequent PET scan was positive in the RLL, right hilum and subcarinal nodes. EBUS/TBNA was performed on 12/18/13, and pathology of RLL and level 7 demonstrated NSCLC/keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. RLL biopsy demonstrated squamous cell carcinoma, subcarinal nodes positive and left sided nodes non diagnostic on pathology but noted to be small on EBUS. In view of N2 disease, patient has now been referred to medical oncology for presumptive stage IIIA lung cancer (T2aN2Mx). She has baseline dyspnea which is unchanged. She has no cough, no hemoptysis. Her weight is stable and she has no fevers. She denies other systemic or cardiopulmonary symptoms. She states that she can walk 4 blocks before needing a rest. She does have moderate arthritis in the bilateral hands. She denies neuropathy. She is able to perform all her activities of daily living. She goes to church regularly, goes to bingo four times a week, continues to drive, and does her cooking, bathing, dressing, cleaning, laundry, and shopping without difficulty. She lives independently and has a son very involved in her care. With respect to her prior larynx cancer, she was treated at Munster Community Hospital. Her son states that chemoradiation was fairly tough  and she did require a feeding tube temporarily. Patient states that she prefers to avoid surgery for her lung cancer. She states that if she requires chemotherapy and radiation, she would prefer a location closer to home and potentially Munster Hospital again.

He is now s/p 3 cycles of carboplatin, abraxane, nivolumab induction on the OPTIMA-II trial. Day 15 was 7/13. Interval History:   He had some trouble with the induction therapy, complaining of fatigue and a mild cough. He did develop neutropenia, with ANC following to 870 on day 22 of cycle 1. Abraxane was dose-reduced to from 100 to 75mg/m2 and he had no neutropenia w/ cycle 2 (also received Granix). However, he developed recurrent neutropenia to ANC 540 in cycle 3 (day 14). The c3/d15 dose of Abraxane was thus reduced to 50mg/m2 (received on 7/13). He has been taking Granix since 7/13 and actually took an extra dose yesterday (so probably a total of 5 doses) since treatment on 7/13. He feels much stronger and more energetic today than he did last week. He denies GI upset, rash, dizziness, neuropathy. He had been running outside quite a lot during the fist 2 cycles of induction, but noted early fatigue and some chest tightness. He did not do as much running during cycle 3 for this reason. Of note, Mr. Shin reports he thinks the tonsillar mass has almost completely disappeared. He hardly notices it when he's swallowing, now. Mucosal surface  appears mildly irregular and may be ulcerated. 5/11/2018: C1D1 Carbo/Abraxane/Nivo On Optima-2  --- ANC 1.07 on d14 (5/24); ANC 870 on d22 (6/1)    6/8/2018: C2D1 Carbo/Abraxane/Nivo on Optima-2; Abraxane reduced to 75mg/m2 for mild neutropenia in c1    6/29/2018: C3D1 Carbo/Abraxane/Nivo on Optima-2;   -- ANC fell to 540 on day 14 (7/12)  -- Dose-reduced Abraxane to 50mg/m2 on c3d15 (7/13)  -- Extra Granix; bump in WBC to 27.6 by day 19 (7/17); ANC 25.69  -- Hb nadir 9.7 on d19 (7/17)      Patient Active Problem List   Diagnosis    Abdominal pain, epigastric    Malignant neoplasm of tonsillar fossa |2018-08-07:	He is s/p 3 cycles of carboplatin, abraxane, nivolumab induction on the OPTIMA-II trial and presents 7/35 treatments of xrt.

She is able to walk 10-15 mins at a brisk pace on a treadmill. Energy level is good. Appetite is good, no weight loss. No fevers, chills, night sweats. She remains relatively active, lives alone, very independent. |2014-03-26:	PET/CT 3/26/14 was positive at the lingular nodule (SUV 6.2). |2014-04-07:	EBUS was performed 4/7/14. |2016-11-02:	CT Chest/Upper Abdomen 11/2/16 demonstrated multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules and micronodules. |2016-11-09:	Marlene Zimmermann is a 80Yrs female with NSCLC. The patient presents to the thoracic medical oncology clinic for an initial consultation. Please allow us to review the patient's history for our records. The patient initially presented in 2010 with a ventral tongue mass as well as a right lower lobe nodule. She was taken to the OR on 2/3/10 where she received both a ventral tongue biopsy, a floor of mouth excision, and a right lower lobe wedge biopsy. Pathology from the floor of mouth lesion demonstrated in-situ and superficially invasive squamous cell carcinoma with positive margins; T1NX. The right lower lobe nodule demonstrated adenocarcinoma, 1.0x0.9x0.9cm, pT1NX, with involved margins. For her NSCLC, on 3/25/10 she was taken back to the OR for a completion lobectomy which was without residual tumor; LN 7 and 4R were negative for malignancy. She received a re-excision and neck dissection of the floor of mouth squamous cell carcinoma on 5/19/10. All LN were negative, though the floor of mouth lesion demonstrated in-situ squamous cell carcinoma extending to inked (new) margin. She received two additional re-excisions on 6/30/10 and 11/5/10, both of which demonstrated in-situ and infiltrating squamous carcinoma. In 2014 she was noted on surveillance CT imaging 3/4/14 to have a lesion at the periphery of the left lingula, which was progressively enlarging (12x18mm). EBUS was performed 4/7/14, which demonstrated negative 11L, 11R, 4R lymph nodes. She was not  a surgical candidate given poor PFTs (FEV1 1.34 L (83% pred), FVC 1.92 L (69% pred), DLCO 75%) and medical comorbidities including age, HTN, and COPD. She ultimately underwent definitive SBRT to 50 Gy in 5 fractions to the left lingular lesion. For example, a lingular lesion increased from 5 to 9mm, a RUL lesion 6x7mm from 4x6mm. The patient was referred to oncology for further evaluation. The patient reports she has some fatigue and chronic back pain, though all of these are stable from previously. She goes to the YMCA three times per week for exercise on the recumbent bike, treadmill, and water walk. She goes to lunch regularly with her friends. She does all the cooking and cleaning in her home. She does have chronic back pain for which she takes dilaudid 2mg PO daily. She denies weight loss, fatigue, cough, hemoptysis. She reports chronic dyspnea with exertion though this does not seem to limit her activities significantly. She also has neuropathy for which she takes lyrica.

He underwent induction chemotherapy then concurrent chemoradiation (10-069) completed on 1/31/11. He was recently diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in left mainstem bronchus and mediastinal lymphadenopathy concerning for recurrence of HCN vs new primary lung cancer. This mass was biopsied and sent to FoundationOne for somatic tumor testing and this identified several abnormalities one of which was a truncating BRCA1 mutation. He has a strong family history of breast and ovarian cancer and thus there was concern re: germline nature of this variant. Of note, his sister who had both breast and ovarian cancer had at one point been tested and also carries a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (report and details not available to the family yet at this time). He is currently undergoing radiation therapy for his current cancer (still debate per patient if was recurrence of H&amp;N cancer or new primary). He denies personal history of other cancers. Had colonoscopy in 2010 that was normal. Had screening PSAs in the past without abnormalities    Mr. Reckamp came to visit today with 8 members of his family to discuss  this family history and role of genetic testing to aid in cancer prevention for the family. All grew up on a farm and had extensive sun exposure and sun burns (german/swedish ancestry)    ONC History   9/2010: He presented with a sore throat and right neck fullness. Exam revealed right neck LAD and enlargement/induration of the right tonsil. Biopsy of right neck LAD revealed metastatic SCCa. Pathology revealed invasive SCCa in the R tonsil (+ LVI) and focus of CIS in the L tonsil. Immunostaining for p16 was positive. He was staged T2N2b. 10/2010-1/2011: He underwent induction chemotherapy with cisplatin/paclitaxel followed by concurrent chemoradiation with cetuximab-FHX to a cumulative dose of 74 Gy in 1.5 Gy BID fractions. On EPIC trial. He was seen in routine follow-up by Drs. Haraf, Portugal, Cohen, and De Souza. There was however new subcarinal lymphadenopathy measuring up to 13-mm and new left interlobar lymphadenopathy. There was interval progression of peribronchial nodules in size and number, now with extrinsic compression of a subsegmental airway in the LLL, possibly representing endovascular or early lymphangitic metastatic disease. Nodular mucosa was found in the left mainstem bronchus. Three small non-obstructing nodules were found in the left lower lobe. There was mediastinal (subcarinal) LAD. LLL and left mainstem endobronchial biopsies were positive for poorly differentiated SCCa. Level 7 LN TBNA was positive for metastatic SCCa. There  was increased narrowing of the proximal left lower lobe bronchi from external compression by the tumor. A more focal left lung base opacity with abnormal increased SUV activity was new compared to recent previous chest CT, possibly representing contiguous tumor spread or infection. There was right paratracheal, subcarinal and left hilar lymphadenopathy with abnormal increased FDG activity and increase in size from previous chest CT exam indicating metastatic lymph node spread. There was interval increase in the abnormal SUV activity in the left pituitary region compared to PET CT from 2011, suspicious for a pituitary macroadenoma. |2014-08-26:	He underwent induction chemotherapy then concurrent chemoradiation (10-069) completed on 1/31/11, now with newly diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma in left mainstem bronchus and mediastinal lymphadenopathy concerning for recurrence of HCN.

With regards to his headaches he has them about 1-2x/week. Described as stabbing pain b/l. Relieved with 400mg motrin. Denies visual changes, N/V, photophobia, eye tearing. Additionally he has required the use of a cane to keep him from falling. He feels the sensation of falling without having something to stabilize him. Denies urinary incontinence, confusion, visual changes, focal weakness, vertigo, paresthesias. |2014-10-28:	He also has  He underwent induction chemotherapy then concurrent chemoradiation (10-069) completed on 1/31/11, now with newly diagnosis squamous cell carcinoma in left mainstem bronchus and mediastinal lymphadenopathy concerning for recurrence of HCN.

He was recently hospitalized from 3/1 to 3/4 for a dislodged GJ tube and underwent successful replacement in IR on 3/1. After this he was feeling in his normal state of health. His wife reported he seemed more confused and sleepy than he normally is, and had one episode of emesis. He was also complaining of mild abdominal pain with diarrhea up to 4 episodes per day over the last week. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath, does endorse cough productive of clear to yellow sputum which is chronic and unchanged recently. Wife reports taking vitals at home: T99.8, BP 130/80. Regarding his baseline BPs, he reports they usually run on the low side of around 80's / 50-60's, and was noted to be as low as 70/42 during his most recent hospitalization which responded to fluids. On arrival to the ER, he was afebrile, HR 68, R 16, BP 64/38, saturating 92% on RA. He had a leukocytosis to 14.6 with bandemia, lactate was 1.8. He received 4L LR with some initial improvement of his BP, but they then dropped back to 60's / 30's and he was started on norepinephrine and admitted to the MICU. MICU Course:  Vasopressors were weaned off on 4/13, but was observed given soft blood pressures (80s/50s)--&gt;never had change in UOP, mentation or lactic acid and this is a chronic issue for him. He was started on vanc/aztreonam/flagyl and got a dose of tobramycin, but was narrowed to  aztreonam. Blood cultures from admission grew GNB, but subsequent cultures were negative. Upon interview, he was feeling well. He had no acute complaints except for some chronic low back pain.

Code stroke was activated from the ER, stat CT head wo showed no intracranial hemorrhage. Neurology consult team felt that acute stroke was unlikely and pt would not have been a candidate for TPA due to active Xarelto treatment. He underwent CTA which showed no acute stroke and no significant stenosis. The etiology of his syncope was thought to be orthostatic hypotension given history of orthostasis and exacerbating medications (rapaflo, scopolamine patch). He did have an elevated troponin on admission which peaked at 0.39 then downtrended. He was chest-pain free and had no acute ischemic changes on EKG. Cardiology was consulted and TTE and device interrogation were both normal. Labs also showed a leukocytosis to 18 with left shift. There was no clear source of infection, CXR showed no infiltrate, UA normal, blood cultures NGTD.

Hemoptysis  Bronch Sept 16 did not identified source. Left Lung Abnormalities: Mucous, plugging the airway, was found in the   superior segment of the left lower lobe (B6). The mucous was copious,   clear, tenacious and thick. The underlying mucosa is normal. Suctioning   was performed and the airway was cleared. Right Lung Abnormalities: Old blood was found in the bronchus   intermedius and in the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe   (B7). The bleeding site was not identified. We reviewed with Dr. Frye   during the procedure. With careful suctioning all blood in the BI and B7   was removed completely. No underlying pathology was noted, no lesions,   and no recurrence or fresh bleeding was noted in any airway. The   procedure was terminated at that time.

It did not involve the tonsil or the palatal glossal fold. It did not extend deep into the ventricle. Although visualization of the tumor was fair he underwent a transoral robotic surgery, done on 4/6/12. He was found to have a T1-T2 carcinoma of the right posterior tongue, size 2.2 x 1.8 x 0.4 cm. Right BOT showed In-situ and infiltrating non-keratinizing squamous carcinoma. The new lateral margin showed squamous mucosa with mild dysplasia, no tumor. Posterior lateral margin showed squamous mucosa, no tumor. Distance to nearest negative margin was 0.2 cm to posterior margin. It invaded submucosa and adjacent soft tissue without vascular and perineural invasion. He was staged pT2, NX. HPV/p16 was negative. On 6/22/12 he was seen for a sore on the right side of his mouth, which led to an oral biopsy in clinic. Right mouth: biopsies showed invasive nonkeratinizing, focally necrotizing squamous cell carcinoma and inflamed surface mucosa with mild dysplasia. He was scheduled to undergo floor of mouth resection. Retromolar trigone showed squamous mucosa and minor salivary gland, no tumor. Right pharynx resection demonstrated invasive keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. New tongue margin showed squamous mucosa, adenoid tissue and skeletal muscle, no tumor. Tumor size was 1.5 x 1.5 x 1.1 cm, single focus, invasive squamous cell carcinoma,  keratinizing, invading submucosa and adjacent soft tissue, with margins negative for tumor with nearest edge, deep margin at soft palate (superior) was 0.1 cm away from invasive carcinoma.

In addition, he had chest imaging as part of his pre-operative work up for his knee replacements a few years ago, which showed pulmonary nodules bilaterally. Patient states he was followed with imaging at the time, which per patient showed regression and/or stability of those lesions. He also had a PET scan at the time which was negative. Initially referred to IR for percutaneous biopsy, but it was felt that given severe emphysematous changes, IR approach would be unadvisable. He completed C1/6.5 FHX from 9/3/2012-9/8/2012. He reports primary side effects of nausea and mouth pain. He noted nausea 2-3 days subsequent to discharge. He is taking TID compazine with moderate relief.

Has chronic low back pain which is unchanged. Pain controlled with analgesics. Pt has no other c/o. PO intake stable. Onc history:   In 2/2012, pt was referred by his PCP to an ENT for hemoptysis. Laryngoscopy revealed BOT mass which prompted CT.  On 3/20/12, CTON revealed a right-sided base of tongue mass that invades the lingular epiglottis/vallecula. The mass is centered on the right and measures approximately 2.7 (transverse) x 2.4 cm (craniocaudal) in size. There are multiple enlarged nodes at level II on the right (a conglomerate of 3 nodes measuring approximately 4 cm in craniocaudal dimension x 1.5 cm in the transverse direction at levels II through III on the right. There is also a nodule at level IV that may represent a tortuous vein. On left level II, there is a 2 cm craniocaudal by x 2 cm transverse node at level II on the left. 04/10/2012: CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis: Calcified right upper lobe granuloma, subcentimeter pulmonary nodule in the right middle lobe, all nonspecific. No definitive evidence of distant metastases. He then transferred his care to the University of Chicago and on  04/12/2012 Dr. Blair performed panendoscopy which revealed no endobronchial lesions. Esophagoscopy revealed a mass in the distal portion of the stomach but biopsies of the lesser curvature in the distal stomach were negative for malignancy. Within the oropharynx lies a base of tongue mass centered on the right which extends into the vallecula. Per operative report, the mass also extends into the laryngeal epiglottis. The oral cavity, pharynx, tonsils, piriform sinus, and post cricoid areas were clear. The left base of tongue was biopsied and found to be negative. The right base of tongue was biopsied and felt to represent squamous cell carcinoma, p16 negative. |2014-03-25:	Paul Pocius is a 62Yrs male here for follow-up of T4aN2c base of tongue SCC (p16-) s/p 5c TFHX (per IRB 10-069) on 8/17/13, then BKM120 x 2 cycles with PD, now D8C1 of Docetaxel/Carboplatin.

In Mid-may, he started to have hemoptysis, saw an otolaryngologist Dr Keenan who referred him to Dr.Stenson, who did a biopsy and pathology showed SCC. CT of the HN (6/9/12) revealed a large infiltrating transglottic laryngeal tumor with occlusion of the airway, extra-laryngeal extension and infiltration of the adjacent soft tissue structures. CT of the chest did not reveal the endobronchial lesion, but showed only two nonspecific micronodules. No specific evidence to suggest pulmonary metastatic disease. He also developed stridor hence necessitating a trach tube. Treatment was held from C1D15 week 2/2 neutropenia which led to dose reduction of both carboplatin and taxol. Today, he is here for f/u. Overall, he is doing better. He breaths better and he feels the track tube is lose and not as tight from tumor effect. On last visit, he had bilateral LE swelling from too much salted ham intake. The swelling has been responding to conservative effect of stockings and leg elevations. Today swelling is decreased from last time. Of note, he has chronic le swelling that comes and goes. Per pt, he has had work-up in the past and the etiology of his leg swelling could not be ascertained. He denies numbness/tingling/n/v/f/sob/cp/abdominal pain. His appetite and energy are both good. |2012-08-13:	Mr. Michael Delgado is a 54yo male here for follow-up of T4N0 supraglottic laryngeal SCC, on C2D15 of induction carbo/taxol. In more detail, Mr. Delgado is a 54yo male with diagnosis of stage IVa, p16+, T4N0 supraglottic SCC diagnosed in 06.12. He initially presented with hoarseness, sore throat and difficulty breathing in May 2012 which did not respond to antibiotics. In mid May, he started having hemoptysis and saw an otolaryngologist (Dr Keenan) who referred him to Dr.Stenson. On 6.8.12, the patient had panendoscopy, tracheostomy for stridor and biopsy showed SCC. Triple endoscopy showed a mostly submucosal tumor of the right aryepiglottic fold extending to the lingual surface of the epiglottis, around through the paraglottic space and involving the left vocal cord. On the left upper lobe takeoff at its junction with the lingula takeoff a small exophytic mass was noted. On pathology review, the biopsy of the false cord lesion revealed in-situ and invasive keratinizing SCC, P16+. The endobronchial bx and brushings revealed invasive SCC. CT of the HN on 6.9.12 revealed a large infiltrating transglottic laryngeal tumor with occlusion of the airway, extra-laryngeal extension and infiltration of the adjacent soft tissue structures. CT of the chest did not reveal the endobronchial lesion, but showed only two nonspecific micronodules, one in the LUL and a subpleural nodule in the RLL, which was read as nonspecific for pulmonary mets. He was started on induction chemotherapy on 6.25.12 with carbo/taxol. Dose reduction was necessary due to neutropenia during C2. Today is C2D15 and he is here for regular follow up, his 5th dose of carbo/taxol and review of his most recent CTs on 8.9.12. CT neck revealed significant reduction in laryngeal mass from 3.8cm down to 2.1cm, but also showed a new RUL 6mm pulmonary nodule (stable 2 LUL and 1 RLL micronodules). He reports feeling well, no pain at trach site, no dysphagia, no shortness of breath/no orthopnea, stable weight, good appetite and energy levels. He notes recurrent LE swelling, which is symmetric, has been intermittently present for the past 5 years, approximately 3-4times/year and has been worked up with ECHO/LE angiograms (per patient) at multiple outside hospitals, with possible diagnosis of venous insufficiency. |2012-08-28:	/  HPI 54 y/o male with T4N0 SGL SCC admitted for C1/5 TFHX  The history is provided by the patient.

In November 2011 he noticed a bump on the right side of his tongue which, at some point, he inadvertently bit into which caused it to ulcerate but it did not heal and, rather, continued to grow. He presented to his local ENT who performed a direct laryngoscopy with biopsy which was positive for poorly differentiated, p16+ SCC (see paraphrased pathology report below). His initial right tongue lesion measured ~2.5 x3 cm at the time of diagnosis. He completed 3 cycles of concurrent cisplatin RT by March of 2012 and by late August, routine imaging picked up bilateral pulmonary nodules which were suspicious for metastatic disease. FNA of one of the lesions confirmed this diagnosis and pt underwent palliative RT to a posterior pulmonary lesion which was in close proximity to the spine along with two other lesions. He received 2 cycles of salvage chemotherapy with carboplatin and Taxol in late August/early September.

The left neck showed a rounded mass, SUV of 8. Origin appeared to be salivary gland, with lateral margins of the anterior left SCM likely involved. 11/30/2012 - left superficial parotidectomy with FN dissection, left neck advancement flap reconstruction, left WLE neck SCCA, level II cervical LN dissection. Pathology notes well to moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of primary parotid gland origin, extending to the posterior and very close to the deep margin, with extensive replacement of 2 paraparotid lymph nodes. Left neck, level 2 lymph nodes: 1/4 lymph nodes positive. Close margins due to facial nerve preservation. Feb/March 2013 - he was treated with 6 weeks of radiation therapy at Silver Cross. Our preliminary records confirm 6600 cGy on 2/1, 5000 cGy on 2/15, and 4000 cGy on 2/26. April/May 2013 - noted to have soft tissue/dermal metastases soon after,  and possibly during end of, radiation treatment. June 2013 - seen in medical oncology clinic at Silver Cross. Asked to see medical and radiation oncology at U Chicago to see if more treatment is possible. While extensive surgical resection was considered, it would require wide excision of left facial and neck skin with flap reconstruction in a patient whose medical status was felt to be fragile with serious risk for morbidity. In addition, his dermal metastases were felt to be a poor prognostic sign, such that systemic options without further RT were favored. As such, he is referred for recurrent parotid gland neoplasm with dermal metastases. Prior therapy has included surgery, radiation. He presents with his family today. His medical co-morbidities include CAD with prior triple bypass surgery. He denies any angina. He notes mild dyspnea with activity. He notes history of CKD, with baseline Cr 2.0. His family notes that his dermal metastases have started to grow in size, and that the ""open area"" appears bigger. He ambulates with a walker or cane due to arthritis. He has lost approximately 15 lbs in the past year. He denies diabetes, but notes a numbness/tingling over his hands and feet. He notes a prior history of carpal tunnel. He has hypothyroidism, replaced with synthroid. He has mild abdominal discomfort, though this is largely over his prior umbilical hernia site. He notes some swelling over the left side of his face, over his soft tissue/mandibular mass. He notes that he sometimes has trouble swallowing. Functionally, his performance status is estimated to be 2. He continues to work in a hobby shop, but is able to work for 1-2 hours before taking a 1 hour break. He feels that he is able to spend approximately 4 hours when he is ""up and about"" during the day. The remainder of the day is spent in a chair, and in particular, he recalls spending most of his day in a  chair/couch during RT treatments.

Her oncologic history is outlined below. She initially presented with sore throat, sore tongue, and sensation of a right sided ""swollen gland."" Her tongue discomfort on the right persisted since summer 2012. The above developed into right neck and jaw discomfort. She denied fevers, chills, sweats, weight loss. Denied dysphagia, voice changes, or SOB. Of note, she has not had prior tobacco use and has only had minimal EtOH use. She subsequently sought evaluation from a dentist, who noted an area of concern at the tongue and referred her to oral surgery. She later met with Dr. Ortega (ENT). 12/20/2012 CT scan of the neck with IV contrast - no definite abnormalities in the region of the tongue. Exam is limited by patient's dental fillings which produce prominent artifact in this area. Remainder of exam is otherwise unremarkable. On 12/27/2012, she underwent direct laryngoscopy with biopsies of tongue with Dr. Ortega. During procedure, there was noted to be a significant firmness and rough quality to the lateral aspect of the posterior tongue extending roughly 4 cm in length and possibly slightly more. Biopsies were taken at the most anterior as well as the most posterior portions along a 4 cm length of mucosa. 12/27/2012 surgical pathology, posterior tongue biopsy - invasive, moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma with keratinization.

Pt was seen in ENT clinic on 4/9 and was stable at that time. Per family, pt was drowsy after being discharged on 4/8. She was complaining of SOB and mild abdominal pain prior to coming to ED. On Wednesday, pt was more lethargic and unresponsive and paramedics were called. Upon presentation to OSH, pt was obtunded with pH 6.99, CO2 103, HCO3 23. She was initially trialed on Bipap but failed quickly. Pt was intubated in the ED for Type II resp failure with elevated CO2. CT head negative for acute process. She was transfused 2u PRBC's and started on Levo for hypotension but unclear timeframe, now off. She was admitted to the CCU 2/2 elevated troponins, however had no EKG changes. Treated pt for PNA and then transferred here for further management. Labs on presentation to OSH: WBC 34.9, Hb 8.3, down to 7.6, plt 190. Initial ABG 6.99/103/138/98/9, consistent with a pure respiratory acidosis with very minimal compensation. CK 33, MB13.7, Trop 0.77, BNP 707, Na 133, AG8, K3.8. C.diff negative.

Of note, a PET perfomed in January 2014 showed the buccal cancer and a small left level Ib SUV 2.3 node, no distant disease. At that time, he was also seen by Dr. Portugal, however, the patient had opted to receive surgery and radiation therapy locally with NorthShore Hospital. He had post-treatment imaging on June 23, 2014 that demonstrated no evidence of disease. However, soon after that time he began to experience intraoral discomfort and pain at the bilateral neck. He underwent further imaging with a CT neck on July 28, 2014 that demonstrated interval development of three enlarged, centrally necrotic right level IIa and IIb lymph nodes and a region of lucency possibly representing central necrosis or ulceration deep and medial to the posterior aspect of the mandibular graft along the buccal mucosa. Additionally, a PET was performed revealing multiple new areas of abnormal hypermetabolism including a lymph node adjacent to the right parotid, bilateral level II, left supraclavicular, left superior paratracheal, and left axillary lymph nodes, as well as a hypermetabolic lytic lesion in the left iliac wing and left upper lobe. The patient had an FNA of an ipsilateral cervical lymph node approximately one week ago that confirmed squamous cell carcinoma and an FNA of the left axillary lymph node soon after (8/7/14), that also confirmed metastatic SCC. He came to UoC for a second opinion on 8/8/14. Given the rapid growth of disease between June and early August, Dr. Campbell planned to start him on systemic chemotherapy as soon as possible. His choice of carbo/taxol was conditioned to reserve cetuximab to a possible second line therapy within the trial "" tivanitnib/cetuximab"", available at Northshore, in addition to the patient being platinum-naive. On 8/8/14, we also discussed clinical trials opened at UoC. However, I personally felt that delaying treatment to enrollment in clinical trials at that point (expected delay of at least 3 weeks, as discussed with RN and CRA at the time), when the patient already have a scheduled chemotherapy, would not be at his best interest. Mr. Patel then received chemotherapy C1D1, C1D8 and C1D15 on 8/28/q4 of carbo/taxol. Dr. Campbell felt the diseaese was not responding clinically and obtained a scan on 9/2/14, which confirmed so. There were growths in the left mandible, posterior parotid and right level 2 nodes. Presently, he reports moderate to severe pain controlled with morphine intraorally and at the bilateral neck. He tolerates a soft or pureed diet by mouth and has never required a feeding tube. He denies dysphagia, odynophagia, hoarseness, or otalgia. He reports he lost approximately 40 pounds between surgery and radiation therapy. He has gained about 10 pounds back and has fluctuated at his current weight of 160 pounds today. He has a brief history of betel-nut use, though denies current use and is a never smoker. No past medical history on file. No Known |2014-09-11:	Bhavesh Patel is a 46Yrs male here for consultation regarding Buccal cancer. HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:     Bhavesh Patel is a 45 year male with history of T3N1M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the left buccal mucosa status post resection with left mandibulectomy with fibular myocutaneous free flap reconstruction, left selective neck dissection followed by adjuvant radiation therapy now with local-regional recurrence and proven distant metastases with progression after one cycle of chemotherapy (carbo/taxol) presenting for a third opinion. He states he first noticed non-healing oral lesions December 2013 and was referred by his dentist to an oral surgeon who took a biopsy and diagnosed him with cancer. He was initially staged as T3N1M0 squamous cell carcinoma of the L buccal mucosa. He underwent resection with left mandibulectomy with fibular myocutaneous free flap reconstruction, left selective neck dissection briefly requiring a tracheostomy in March 2014. He then had adjuvant radiation therapy (no chemotherapy) which he completed in May 2014. He underwent further imaging with a CT neck on July 28, 2014 that demonstrated interval development of three enlarged, centrally necrotic right level IIa and IIb lymph nodes and a region of lucency possibly representing central necrosis or ulceration deep and medial to the posterior aspect of the mandibular  graft along the buccal mucosa. He was seen by his primary oncologist Dr. Campbell at Northshore who started him on chemotherapy. He received C1D1 (carbo/taxol), C1D8 (taxol) and C1D15 (taxol) on 8/28/14. The patient and Dr. Campbell both felt clinically his disease was progressing while actively on chemotherapy. Thus, repeat imaging was obtained 9/2 which did confirm progression of disease with growths in L mandible, posterior parotid, and R level 2 nodes. He presented to UofC for second opinion on 8/8/14 and was evaluated by Dr. DeSouza. Clinical trials were discussed and he ultimately signed consent for MK trial. He was also considering participation in tivantinib vs cetuximab trial through NorthShore. He presents today for third opinion. He has difficulty opening his mouth but has continued to tolerate a soft or pureed diet by mouth and has never required a feeding tube. He states he has lost about 50 pounds between surgery and radiation but currently has been stable. He feels his lymph nodes continue to enlarge and he is concerned about delaying treatment. He denies tobacco or EtOh use. He has a brief history of betel-nut use. |2014-09-21:	Buccal cancer.

He reported that he took the clindamycin as prescribed on prior admission. He also reports having a rash on his b/l arms, legs and trunk that has been present since starting the new clinical trial medication. ED: In the ED, the patient was seen by ENT, and was deemed to have a stable/slightly increased laryngeal edema on flex laryngoscopy, with a R sided mass concerning for underlying abscess. Patient was started on Vancomycin and ordered for CT head/neck with contrast. ENT recommended steroids but to give racemic epinephrine if steroids can't be given due to trial.

Interval history:   His treatment on MK-3475 has been complicated by severe post-treatment face and upper airway edema requiring hospital admission. He was admitted on 9/24-9/27 after cycle 1 for increased facial edema and difficulty breathing. Unfortunately edema progressed after discharge and he presented again to the ED on 9/29 for admission. He had tracheostomy placed 10/2 for airway protection. He received cycle 2 on 10/9 with recurrence of severe facial and upper airway edema.

On arrival at bedside, his respiratory rate had spontaneously fallen and saturations had returned to &gt;98%, however the patient was noted to be significantly agitated, felt short of breath, and had significant belly breathing, despite obvious retractions in his neck. ENT was noted to have scoped the patient earlier in the day and did not find any mucous plugging at that time, but did see some consolidation down the right bronchial tree with purulence and a foul smell. X-ray also showed right sided infiltration and significant effusion. Patient was re-evaluated 30 minutes later and noted to still be in significant distress, but had more extensive use of accessory muscles and was tripoding, so he was transferred to the MICU in anticipation of further deterioration of his respiratory status that might require. Thoracentesis was performed in the unit and approximately 1.6L of fluid was removed; cytology and gram stain are pending and need to be followed up on. Approximately 30 minutes after thoracentesis, the patient's respiratory function greatly improved; respiratory rate fell to within  normal range, he had much less labored breathing, O2 requirement was weaned down to 40% and his saturations remained stable between 93-100%. Overnight, his condition remained stable and thus he was transferred back to the floor. |","['SCC', 'tumor', 'cancer', 'buccal cancer', 'Buccal cancer', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'tumor/local inflammation']",2014-01-20,2014-01-20: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF CHEEK MUCOSA|2014-08-08: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF HEAD FACE AND NECK|2014-08-12: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF TONGUE UNSPECIFIED|2014-09-18: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF BASE OF TONGUE|2014-09-29: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF OTHER SPECIFIED SITES|,2014-09-18: SECONDARY AND UNSPECIFIED MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF LYMPH NODES OF HEAD FACE AND NECK|,

He finall saw his PCP who thought he had an allergy and prescribed some medication but no relief. Eventually he saw an ENT who di a CT and saw nodules in the neck. That led to surgery by the surgeon in August of 2013. HA persisted after surgery, got worse so he went to see a neurologist who end up referring him to a different ENT surgeon where he was told that he may have squamous cell cancer and referred him to UoC. He was seen by Dr Stenson who ordered CT, percutaneous biopsy of his palpable nodes in the neck. Pt was sent here for mat of his HA. Pt described his HA as mostly Right sided/Rt Half of the Head/FAce. Pain is persistent, localized to ear, behind the head and around the ey. Its like a heavy sensation, quite intense without meds and will not let him function. He has tried multiple meds like Vicodin, Norco, neurontin, Fioricet, Imitrex.

Continues to take 5 cans of tube feeds a day--nothing but mouth as it triggers a cough. |","['SCC', 'tumor', 'cancer', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'primary head/neck cancer']",2014-03-27,"2014-03-27: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF HEAD FACE AND NECK|2014-04-14: OTHER MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF UNSPECIFIED SITE|2014-05-02: SECONDARY AND UNSPECIFIED MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF LYMPH NODES OF HEAD FACE AND NECK|2014-05-06: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF OTHER SPECIFIED SITES|2014-10-08: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF BRAIN AND SPINAL CORD|2014-12-03: SECONDARY AND UNSPECIFIED MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF LYMPH NODES OF AXILLA AND UPPER LIMB|2015-10-02: SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF SKIN, UNSPECIFIED|2017-02-10: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF UNSPECIFIED LUNG|","2014-08-06: SECONDARY AND UNSPECIFIED MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF LYMPH NODES OF MULTIPLE SITES|2014-10-07: SQUAMOUS CELL CARCINOMA OF SKIN SITE UNSPECIFIED|2014-12-03: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF LUNG|2015-04-03: SECONDARY AND UNSPECIFIED MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF LYMPH NODES SITE UNSPECIFIED|2015-10-02: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF BRAIN|2015-10-02: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF HEAD, FACE AND NECK|2016-02-09: SEC & UNSP MALIG NEOP OF AXILLA & UP LMB NODES|2016-02-09: MALIG NEOP OF UNSP PART OF UNSP BRONC OR LUNG|2016-04-21: SEC & UNSP MALIG NEOP OF NODES OF HEAD FACE & NK|2016-05-17: SEC MALIG NEOP OF OTH PARTS OF NERVOUS SYSTEM|",

Prior oncologic history includes:  Stage IVB T4aN2c HPV-positive SCC R tonsil s/p cis/RT with CR, with 1st recurrence with R neck LAD in 08.13 s/p R neck dissection and 2nd recurrence in 12.13 with a large R orbital tumor with ethmoid cell invasion, progressed on carbo/docetaxel and presenting for further management plans. In more detail, Mr. Castro initially started noticing a R neck mass approximately in 11.12. He was referred to an ENT specialist and a biopsy of a R tonsilar mass on 11.13.12 revealed p16-positive moderately differentiated SCC. Concurrent CRT with cis/RT was started on 12.27.12 till 2.22.13 (D1, 22,43) with a CR achieved. The patient was clinically and radiographically followed and he was found to have a 1st recurrence in the R neck in 08.13 (PET/CT 7.30.13: 2 small foci of increased uptake in the R neck at level II cervical region-SUV 4.9-, ~ 1cm each) which was managed with a R neck dissection on 8.15.13 which showed 2/4 R level II/III LNs positive for metastatic SCC (max size 0.8cm) and a small focus of SCC in fibrous tissue. On 12.23.13, the patient was found to have a 2nd recurrence with a R medial canthus biopsy c/w metastatic SCC. Additional biopsy from a R cheek skin lesion on 1.8.14 further confirmed SCC. He was started on carboplatin/docetaxel on 1.22.14 and was continued up 3 cycles till 3.12.14, when he was felt to have progressed clinically. His most recent CT neck on 4.4.14 showed enhancing soft tissue nodules involving the R face/neck dermis, superficial lobe of the R parotid gland and R orbit which had increased in size (c/t CT on 3.5.14). The R inferior medial orbital mass was shown to have increased from 3.9x3.3cm to  4.4x4.8cm, with extension of this mass into the adjacent anterior ethmoid air cells with bone destruction involving the lamina papyracea and the ethmoid air cell septa which is more prominent. The mass caused displacement of the globe to the right and mild worsening proptosis. The lesion at the inferior margin of the superficial lobe of the R parotid gland had also increased from 0.7x0.5cm to 1x3cm. Smaller dermal lesions of the R face and superficial lobe of the R parotid gland were also shown to have increased minimally. A soft tissue massin the pterygopalatine fossa and the posterior of the nasal cavity appeared to have increased minimally in size too. No tumor was seen in the T tonsil tumor bed.No neck LAD was noted either. CT chest on the same day was negative for metastatic disease in the lungs. Currently, the patient reports the following:   - nasal stuffiness   - xerostomia   - R eye ""irritation"", 2-3/10, requires 2 norcos (hydrocodonee 5mg/acetaminophen 325mg) prior to sleeping   - dysphagia   - weight loss, 50p since his diagnosis and 5p over the past 1 month   - fatigue    No past medical history on file.

At the time of diagnosis the patient did not have an identifiable primary. Final pathology revealed the primary tumor in the left tonsil with multiple positive LN in the left neck with evidence of ECE. We have no record of p16 staining; however, the tumor tested positive for high risk HPV. The patient received adjuvant chemotherapy under the direction of Dr. Herbert Reisel together with adjuvant radiation under the care of Dr. James Ruffer. The 3rd cycle of bolus cisplatin was held secondary to local side effects in the radiation field. Per the patient, he lost roughly 30 lbs over the course of his CRT. He recovered completely from his prior CRT. PET-CT performed at an OSH on 9/12/2014 revealed FDG avidity at the site of pain/swelling on the left with an associated mass at the left skull base with involvement of the vertebral artery and likely CN X, XI, and XII. The patient's pain is now improved considerably with the addition of narcotics and PO steroid. Inferiorly this mass extends up to the tail of the parotid gland with loss of intervening fat plane. Findings consistent with known recurrent squamous cell carcinoma.

Further, MRI of the skull base on 2/19/15 demonstrated interval increase size of signal abnormality in the left sided skull base. Inferiorly, it extended down to the left carotid bifurcation with increased infiltration into the adjacent paraspinal muscles and into the occipital bone and the inferior aspect of the petrous temporal bone. There was mild edema in the left masticator space, left parotid gland and along the superificial soft tissues of left lower cheek with associated mild fat stranding. There was stable mild enhancement along the mastoid segment of the left facial nerve. PET/CT on the same day demonstrated interval development of hypermetabolic left level II lymph node. There was mild to moderately decreasing metabolic activity in the known soft tissue thickening/ lesion with underlying bone destruction in the left stylomastoid region. CT of the neck earlier today demonstrated a necrotic mass at the left carotid bifurcation with partial encasement of the proximal left internal carotid artery, corresponding to the increased uptake seen on PET.

The patient presents to the head and neck medical oncology clinic for an initial consultation and to discuss possible clinical trial options. Please allow us to review the patient's history for our records. Mr. Harnett was originally diagnosed with T2N1M0 epiglottis cancer in 2010. He was treated with induction chemotherapy followed by radiation and did well afterwards until the summer of 2014 when he began developing tongue pain, weight loss, and decreased appetite. A PET scan was done which showed recurrent disease of the right tongue and tongue base. 6/2014 - PET scan - increased uptake in the oral cavity to the right of the midline contiguous to the lateral aspect of the tongue. 17.6x33.8mm. Multifocal uptake in the bilateral lower anterior hemithorax at the pleural interface corresponding to calcified plaque formation. He underwent resection of his tongue. 7/28/15 - Pathology - right hemiglossectomy and portion of tongue base - invasive moderately differentiated keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Level 1,2, and 3 lymph nodes negative. P16 IHC stain is negative. He was started on therapy with carboplatin/taxol/erbitux. He has tolerated this well, with only a few delays due to fatigue. He was treated with this therapy until 2-3 weeks ago. Around 2 weeks ago he began developing skin lesions along his neck that have increased rapidly in size. They are causing compression due to mass effect. He states his quality of life is miserable. He is constantly coughing up secretions. Imaging shows -      5/29/2015 - CT scan - Recurrent oral tumor along the flap with adjacent necrotic submandibular lymph nodes. Nonspecific rim enhancing fluid collection in the left parapharyngeal space which may represent sequela of treatment, necrotic nodes, or potential abscess. Extensive neck edema and laryngeal edema related to treatment. Stable spiculated left upper lobe nodule. He has developed some tongue swelling during this time, which he has been getting treatment with prednisone (last dose 2 days ago). This was helping with the swelling somewhat. Other than the skin lesions, he is doing okay. He remains active. He drives his wife to work and is working around the house most of the day. His weight is stable with g-tube feeds.

Marked skin itching that started with pembrolizumab treatment (treated with antihistamines and topical steroid) and was ultimately treated with oral prednisone, however with little improvement. Multiple CTs after discontinuation confirm CR. However he developed a lesion under his chin that was biopsied by Dr. Gooi on 6/2/16 --&gt; + SCC recurrence. His wife and daughter are with him today and feel the lesion under his chin is growing. He reports pain under his chin as well as generalized aches and pains. He was previously on a 50mcg fentanyl patch that he d/c'd several months ago. His wife restarted the 50mcg fentanyl patch yesterday w/o contacting anyone. He also has MSIR for breakthrough pain which he hasn't been taking. He is more tired today, but denies feeling drowsy or lethargic. His energy level has overall decreased over the past 2 weeks. He is laying the majority of the day and no longer running errands. He continues to report persistent pruritus, which has worsened since resuming pembrolizumab. He receives 6 cans of Jevity 1.5 through his gtube daily. Tolerates nothing by mouth. His weight is stable. Denies fevers/chills, n/v/d/c, shortness of breath. Oncologic History:  Mr. Harnett was originally diagnosed with T2N1M0 epiglottis cancer in 2010. He was treated with induction chemotherapy followed by radiation  and did well afterwards until the summer of 2014 when he began developing tongue pain, weight loss, and decreased appetite. |2016-07-19:	Martin Harnett is a 79Yrs male with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma on the KeyNote 55 trial with the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab started 7/20/2016, achieved CR, held treatment, but now has recurrence and restarted Pembrolizumab. However cancer is continuing to grow rapidly. Also complains of ongoing severe pruritus, which bothers him a lot. His energy level is decreased. |2016-07-20:	Martin Harnett is a 79Yrs male with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma on the KeyNote 55 trial with the anti--PD1 antibody pembrolizumab started 7/20/2016. |2016-07-29:	Martin Harnett is a 79Yrs male with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma previously on the KeyNote 55 trial with the anti-PD1 antibody pembrolizumab started 7/20/2015, achieved CR, held treatment, but then developed recurrence and restarted Pembrolizumab on 6/14/16. However his cancer grew rapidly and pembrolizumab was discontinued after 2 treatments. He is now receiving palliative carboplatin/docetaxel/cetuximab and presents for C1D8. He notes significant reduction of his submental lesion after one dose of carboplatin/docetaxel/cetuximab. Unfortunately he developed worsening fatigue over the last week, and states he is laying/sitting the majority of the day and unable to do things around the house. He has also developed a severe cetuximab rash on his back, chest, arms, legs, and scalp, and continues to report persistent pruritus which developed while he was receiving pembrolizumab. This has not yet improved. His neck pain remains stable. He is no longer on fentanyl, and has not been taking MSIR. He is receiving  4-6 cans of Jevity 1.5 through his gtube daily. He has lost 4 lbs since last week. His ANC dropped to 130 today. He denies any fevers/chills at home, but his temp is noted to be 99.3-100.2 in IVT today. He denies n/v/d/c, abdominal pain, dysuria, worsening cough, neuropathy. |2016-07-31:	/ HPI |2017-08-01:	so he started that on 8/1/17. |2017-08-01:	Martin Harnett is an 80Yrs male with recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinoma previously on the KeyNote 55 trial with the anti-PD1antibody pembrolizumab, palliative carboplatin/docetaxel/cetuximab, carboplatin/taxol, and carbo/gem who presents to start C1D1 of pembrolizumab again. Most of the history is given by his daughter, Kathy who presents with patient. Kathy notes that patient's wife had a stroke three weeks ago and is coming home tomorrow. Patient has had difficulty with his wife's absence and has been ""even more depressed"" lately--sleeps the majority of the day and watches television for the remainder. She notes that she and her four siblings have worked out a schedule so someone is with him at home most of the time for help with ADLs. Patient denies shortness of breath, chest pain, nausea, vomiting but notes he has pain on his left neck (around tumor recurrence site) for which he takes Roxanol intermittently (no longer using fentanyl patch). He is also bothered by a cough and the amount of mucus which constantly drips from his trach. Patient did present with a fever to 38.5 for which blood cultures were taken. He then received palliative carboplatin/docetaxel/cetuximab and again had a CR  (despite previously not responding to simialar chemotherapy - suggesting interaction with prior pembrolizumab). He continued chemotherapy at Weiss with Dr. Shulman with carboplatin/taxol--treatment course complicated by severe pruritis/skin itching. Then tumor recurred (submental and marked facial swelling again), so carboplatin/taxol stopped working--last dose ~May 2017. He then started carbo/gem with combo of aprepitant/cetirizine (off label use for itching), but well justified for nausea issues as well. Insurance then authorized single-agent pembro only, so he started that on 8/1/17. |2017-08-11:	HD stable and transferred to the floor 8/11/17. |2017-08-11:	HD stable and transferred to the floor 8/11/17 with likely aspiration PNA. |2017-08-12:	/ HPI  80 year old man with locally invasive laryngeal squamous cell CA s/p multiple treatments currently receiving pembrolizumab admitted for bleeding from tracheostomy site and associated hypoxia. Initially admitted to MICU for stabilization, received CT angio of the neck which found pseudoaneurysm of L external carotid now s/p coiling. This morning Mr. Harnett is sitting comfortably in bed and complains of being cold. He denies jaw or neck pain, headache, light headedness, abdominal pain, or shortness of breath. He is breathing comfortably on room air and is not using any supplemental oxygen via trach collar. |2017-08-13:	Overnight, Mr. Harnett was seen to be regurgitation yellow fluid from his trach site shortly after a bolus of his tube feeds. He was suctioned and tube feeds were held overnight. This morning Mr. Harnett is sitting comfortably in bed and complains of diffuse itching. |","['SCC', 'tumor', 'cancer', 'oral tumor', 'neck cancer', 'submental tumor', 'squamous cell carcinoma', 'T2N1M0 epiglottis cancer', 'neck squamous cell carcinoma']",2015-06-09,"2015-06-09: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF OTHER SPECIFIED SITES|2015-06-26: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF HEAD FACE AND NECK|2015-10-01: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF HEAD, FACE AND NECK|2015-10-13: SEC & UNSP MALIG NEOP OF NODES OF HEAD FACE & NK|2016-03-24: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF BORDER OF TONGUE|2016-06-02: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF TRIGONE OF BLADDER|2017-08-09: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF LARYNX, UNSPECIFIED|",2015-06-26: SECONDARY MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF SKIN|2016-01-24: MALIGNANT NEOPLASM OF SUPRAGLOTTIS|,

Mr. Hardesty's oncologic history is as follows:     He first completed treatment with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (cisplatin + RT) in January 10, 2014. He recently developed swelling in the face and the upper left neck and left submandibular region; he was treated with a course of antibiotic therapy after examination by his radiation oncologist Dr. McGee did not demonstrate any recurrent disease. The antibiotics did not help and a CT scan was performed on August 19, 2015 which demonstrated edematous thickening and stranding of the supraglottic structures consistent with post-treatment changes but also demonstrated some new non-enlarged lymph nodes in the left supraclavicular region which were felt to most likely represent reactive changes. This scan also demonstrated some paratracheal lymph nodes and a CT chest was subsequently done for these findings. This CT chest showed a new dominant solid-appearing nodule in the right lower lobe with ground glass nodule in the left lower lobe as well as some peribronchial nodularity in the inferior lingula. There was an increased number and slightly increased prominence of multiple small right and left paratracheal lymph nodes. A follow up PET was done on August 31, 2015 which showed a hypermetabolic right lower lobe pulmonary nodule and mediastinal lymph nodes which were suspicious for malignancy. He had some low level uptake within the nodular opacities and the lingula which were felt to be post inflammatory. Bronchial washings did not show malignancy but biopsy of the left  paratracheal nodes showed squamous cell carcinoma that was positive for p63, CK5/7, and high risk HPV. TTF1 was negative. The right lower lung BAL was negative for malignant cells. Right paratracheal lymph node biopsy did not show any abnormal lymphocyte population. Right paratracheal biopsy also showed squamous cell carcinoma. Today he is accompanied by his wife. He overall feels quite well other than the persistent swelling on the left side of his neck. He has had some persistent hoarseness as well. He has an excellent energy level and only intermittently becomes short of breath. He has been seen locally in Peoria where his oncologist is attempting to enroll him on a nivolumab trial, however a requirement of this trial is receiving standard of care cytotoxic therapy in the 6 months prior to the trial which he has not received. He and his wife are currently petitioning the drug company to enroll on this trial. He has also been seen at MD Anderson where the MEDI0562 Phase I trial was offered to him. He has a spot in this trial if he would like it - he was told the chance of success with this trial is very high and the drug is likely to be approved per their report. He has also been offered a standard of care treatment consisting of carboplatin + cetuximab + 5FU or carboplatin + cetuximab + taxane based therapy which he could receive in Peoria. He is interested in getting a third opinion here at UCMC today and also to see if there are any treatments available here. He is willing to travel here if necessary. He also is curious about prognosis - he was told his prognosis is somewhere between 6-8 months.

Ms. Sanders presented with presented to OSH PCP with facial and neck swelling and given antibiotics without relief. She then presented with acute worsening in swelling of her tongue and shortness of breath, felt to be angioedema secondary to ACE inhibitor. However during this work-up, she underwent CT neck (4/25/15) demonstrating extensive, partially necrotic adenopathy in right neck at submandibular, internal jugular deep cervical chain extending inferiorly to level of right clavicle (full read below). On 5/5/15, she underwent core needle biopsy of right neck lymph node. This was consistent with ""malignant epithelioid neoplasm consistent with metastatic cancer."" She underwent further staging with direct laryngoscopy 5/28/15, final stage pT2N3 (patholgoy below) supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma. At the beginning of June 2015, a Gtube was placed. She was evaluated with radiation (Dr. Michael Spiotto) and medical oncology (Dr. Lucy Chen) with recommendation for definitive chemoradiation with cisplatin 100mg/m2 Day 1, 22, 43 and 33 treatments of radiation (region treated PTV1, daily fraction 212cGy; PTV2, daily fraction 180cGy). On  7/6/15 she started chemo/radiation completed 8/19/15; course was complicated by nausea, skin irritation (grade 3 desquamation), and grade 2-3 mucositis and she only had 2 rounds of chemotherapy at day 1 and 22. Per patient, at that time, she was also diagnosed with a LLE DVT (no documentation at time of consultation regarding this event, however, per patient she needed IV blood thinners via left groin sheath and ultrasound of her heart). She was sent home on Lovenox which she d/c'd because she had worsening LE swelling which she attributed to the drug; no easy bleeding or bruising aside from expected abdominal swelling. Her oncologist had told her to continue this medication. On 9/5/15, she presented to the ED with stridor and difficulty breathing and started on steroids for suspected laryngeal edema; per report she underwent laryngoscopy at that time demonstrating airway narrowing with an exophytic mass although notes mention a ""seemingly complete locoregional response"". She is completing her steroid taper this week. Further work-up was consistent with 9/9/15 CT chest demonstrating new R axillary retropectoral lymph node suspicious for metastasis which was biopsied 9/18/15 and showed metastatic squamous cell carcinoma. 10/5 PET scan also concerning for inguinal lymph node involvement, residual vocal cord disease, right axillary lympadenopathy (read below).

He had noticed some intermittent sore throat over the past year and then over the past 6 months has noticed swelling in the R neck- he saw ENT at NorthShore  2 weeks ago for further evaluation and was found to have a mass on the right base of tongue. He had FNA of the R neck lymph node which showed squamous cell carcinoma, p16 positive. He reports that he is feeling reasonably well and denies ongoing throat pain, dysphagia, otalgia or shortness of breath. He reports that energy level is stable. PS 0. His past medical history is significant for prostate cancer (Gleason 3+4 per patient history) s/p radical prostatectomy in Sept. 2014. Images:    10/6/15: CT Neck w/ contrast  (summary of findings) : the nasopharynx is unremarkable. There is a 1.3 x 1.9cm enhancing mass of the R lateral base of tongue. It likely measures at least 1.9cm in craniocaudal dimension and may slightly invade the R posterior lateral aspect of the right genioglossus muscle. It also abuts the medial margin of the R hyoglossus muscle which could be invaded by the mass. The mass does not cross the midline. It does extend to the right glossotonsillar sulcus. The hypopharynx, larynx and visualized proximal trachea are unremarkable. Cervical soft tissues: there is pathologic R cervical lymphadenopathy. There is a conglomerate right level 2A nodal station mass measuring approximately 3 x 1.5cm and there are areas of central and gliosis within this mass. Portion of this right level 2A nodal station lymph node mass abuts and is inseprable from the medial margin of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle. This R level 2A nodal station LN mass also  abuts and moderately effaces the proximal R IJ vein. A portion abuts the proximal R external carotid artery. There are multiple additional lymph nodes reported at right level 2A, R 3 and at R 3/4 nodal station- several lymph nodes prominently enhancing and findings most consistent w/ metastatic lymphadenopathy. 10/9/15: NM PET Scan:(summary of findings)  Hypermetabolism on the right side of the base of the tongue w/ associated mass (SUV 13.2)  is consistent with malignancy. Hypermetabolism in R level 2A/2B cervical lymph nodes and in a right cervical node at the border of levels 3 and 4. No other  Areas of abnormal hypermetabolism are demonstrated. CT images demonstrate no lung nodules within the limitations of the nonbreath-hold CT technique which is not optimized to detect micronodules. There is a low attenuation lesion in there right kidney, adrenals and pancreas appear normal w/in the limitations of the low dose noncontrast CT technique. There are 2 small hypervascular lesion seen within the liver and one small cystic lesion within the spleen. These are felt to be most likely to be benign even in this patient w/ a known malignancy. PAST MEDICAL, SURGICAL, SOCIAL, AND FAMILY HISTORY |2015-10-28:	He had noticed some intermittent sore throat over the past year and then over the past 6 months has noticed swelling in the R neck - he saw ENT at NorthShore for further evaluation and was found to have a mass on the right base of tongue.

The patient first presented in March with swelling of the right neck, and was given a prescription for antibiotics by his PCP, with subsequent improvement. He then again presented in late summer with worsened apnea symptoms and heavy, wheezing breathing. At that time he received a CT scan of the neck, which demonstrated a 3.2 cm right oropharynx mass, with two right cervical lymph nodes. Biopsy was performed in October, which was consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. We do not have access to this report currently, but it reportedly showed an FDG avid primary of the oropharynx with FDG avid ipsilateral nodes (2). Dr. Haraf performed a laryngoscopy on 11/25/2015, which demonstrated: a mass present in the soft palate, visible from the oropharynx. The tumor began at the midline and extended down the right tonsil, displacing the uvula. Repeat CT scans have been performed as below.

Please allow us to review the patient's history for our records. September 2015 - Noted a lump in his right neck which was painless while shaving. A few weeks later, he went to his PCP and was prescribed a Z-Pak. The lesion did not respond. December - Returned to PCP office. CT scan was performed without contrast. Notable for a 2.5cm lymph node in the right level IIA region with several smaller lymph nodes adjacent to this. There was no evidence of other abnormalities. Imaging was reviewed by rad onc, who noted a 15x18x15mm prominent lymph node superior to the one noted on the official read. Referred to Dr. David Hemmer. On his exam, did not see any obvious lesions in the oral cavity, nasopharynx, oropharynx, or hypopharynx. No biopsies were taken. 1/8/16 - underwent a surgical excision of the lymph node (not felt to be a candidate for needle aspiration by IR). In operative report, noted that there is an enlarged lymph node in the cephalad direction from the node that was resected. Final pathology demonsrated metastatic poorly differntiated SCC, 3cm in size with no extracapsular extension of tumor. A p16 stain was performed and was strongly positive. 1/16/16 - CT scan of chest - 1.6x1.cm left adrenal mass. No pulmonary abnormalities. Per Dr. Nabrinskiny's note from 1/27/16, this is an adrenal adenoma that is NOT new. 1/20/16 - PET scan - right neck node that was hypermetabolic with an SUV of 13 and that corresponded to the smaller lymph node noted on OR report. No other areas of nodal uptake. Increased uptake in the base of tongue/lateral pharyngeal wall on the right side with SUV of 6.8. Referred back to Dr. Hemmer. Thought to have some fullness on right BOT and right lateral pharyngeal area. Underwent biopsy which demonstrated fragments of benign lympho-epithelial tissue with acute and chronic inflammation, consistent with lingual tonsillar tissue. No carcinoma present. Referred to UCM to discuss OPTIMA trial and for further workup of primary site. He was seen by both Dr. Haraf and Dr. Agrawal today. He underwent a biopsy of his right tonsil.

His chin numbness progressed and he also developed oropharyngeal pain and multiple dental issues in May 2015.These symptoms led to left-sided mandibular wisdom tooth extraction and was noted to have an erosive process within the mandible. In May 2015 he underwent biopsy confirming invasive carcinoma involving the mandible, originally diagnosed as invasive SCC. Subsequent mandibulectomy with bilateral radical neck dissection and reconstruction occurred in may 20, 2015 at Indiana University. Pathology was consistent with high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma 9.5 cm in size with extensive involvement of the mandible, perineural invasion, lymphovascular invasion, positive margin at the pterygoid, and 6/65 bilateral positive lymph nodes with metastatic disease. From June-August 2015, he underwent  concurrent chemoradiation with cisplatin and intensity modulated radiation therapy to the bilateral necks, oral cavity/floor of mouth with special attention to the left pterygoid region and the skull base( total 60 Gy). Three months after the completion of adjuvant CRT, he had a PET/CT scan in November 2015 which showed uptake in a new sternal lesion. FNA of lesion was performed and showed features similar to mucoepidermoid carcinoma. At the completion of RT, Jan 2016 CT C/A/P showed enlarged sternal lesion and increase in size was attributed to inflammation. However, surveillance PET in 4/19/2016 showed uptake at R subcarinal/paraesophageal LN in mediastinum that was increased in size  from prior CT from Jan 2016 along with a Faint focus in R hilar region, Uptake at sternal metastasis, Post-op uptake within face/neck, and Low-grade uptake within L aspect of tongue. These hypermetabolic nodes at station 7 and 11R were sampled during bronch with EBUS and consistent with spread from mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Most recently, he reports that the plate placed during his reconstruction has become exposed over the last two weeks. He overall feels well. He is a 4th grade teacher but not currently working says diagnosis. His energy level is pretty good and he remains relatively active doing household chores, completing his own ADLs, gardening, driving, mowing the line, etc. He does note some increased fatigue on some days and notes being active at least 50% of most days. He is getting his nutrition primarily through the G-tube but is able to take some soft foods by mouth. He endorses dry mouth, drooling, dysphagia, neck stiffness, and trouble with mastification. His weight has been relatively stable after an initial signifcant weight loss at the time of diagnosis. He had met with our radiation oncologist, Dr. Haraf who advised consideration of systemic therapy with possible radiation at a later date. He also met with our ENT colleague,, Dr. Blair who cultured his left sinus tract and ordered CT neck and chest imaging to further assess his disease. Oncology history( as summarized by rad onc):  Thanksgiving 2014: He developed L chin numbness that was progressive to the R chin; he also had trismus. He underwent steroid injections without benefit. He saw several healthcare providers, including ENT and dental, without a diagnosis. 4/23/15: Path of lower left mandible revealed focally keratinizing SCC,  moderately differentiated. Could not exclude possibility of high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. He was evaluated at Indiana University, who noted an expansile lesion involving most of L hemimandible and L masticator space; moderate trismus. 5/4/15: CT neck revealed lytic mildly enhancing mass involving R parasymphyseal, midline, and L hemimandible. There were nonenlarged but mild-moderately suspicious L level Ib and IIA LN. CT chest negative for pulmonary mets; nonspecific mediastinal and R hilar LN. 5/20/15: Per outside records, a L hemimandibulectomy was planned, but due to extent of disease at the time of surgery, he underwent composite mandible resection/FOM resection, b/l ND, and resection of facial skin with R fibula flap for reconstruction and b/l TMJ prosthesis. Final path revealed central mucoepidermoid carcinoma, high-grade, 9.5cm. There was +LVI, +PNI. Main resection margins were positive anterior soft tissue, medial soft tissue, medial mucosal margin, FOM mucosal margin, inferior soft tissue of anterior mandible. There were 6/65 LN (at R level IB, L level IB, L levels II-IV, and in ""main mandibular resection"" specimen), max 1.2 cm, +ECE. Staging was pT4aN2c.

His oncologic history is as follows:   He first noticed some difficulty swallowing 3-4 months prior to presentation but attributed this to a chronic cough stemming from bronchitis. He had a PET scan performed that demonstrated high uptake in the right base of the tongue and at level of on the right side of the neck. This was corroborated on physical exam which demonstrated a 3 cm x 3 cm right cervical node at level II. A flexible laryngoscopy was performed and demonstrated lingual fullness at the base of the tongue but no discrete mass. The right cervical node was ultimately biopsied via FNA and returned metastatic moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, p16 immunoperoxidase stain positive. He was immediately referred to UCMC for further care. He comes to clinic today with his wife and brother. He is doing well and has not noticed a dramatic worsening of his symptoms. He does have slightly increased pain at the site of his right lymph node. His performance status is good and he actively works around the yard and golfs. He intermittently drinks but does not smoke any longer - quit 20 years ago after a 30 pack year history. His main questions today involve his stage, what treatment regimen he will receive, and if he can receive some of the therapy closer to home in Crown Point, IN. He intermittently has positional lightheadedness for which he sees a cardiologist.

Postoperative findings related to total laryngectomy with flap reconstruction and  tracheostomy with persistent ill-defined soft tissue along the superior left margin of the  flap, which may represent treated tumor. Follow up via PET may be useful. No evidence of residual cervical lymphadenopathy based on size criteria. 3. Postoperative findings related to left temporal lobe arteriovenous malformation  embolism with a retained microcatheter in the entire course of the left carotid artery. CT chest 1/20/17:  IMPRESSION:     1. No evidence of pulmonary metastases. New groundglass opacity near the left apex most  likely reflects acute radiation pneumonitis. Lymph nodes in the mediastinum and axillary regions remain abnormal in multiplicity but  are no longer enlarged. Numerous small mesenteric lymph nodes are also noted and  hepatosplenomegaly is present. Correlate for lymphoproliferative disorder. Left posterior perinephric soft tissue and stranding most likely represents  retroperitoneal fibrosis. 4. Incompletely visualized chronically retained iatrogenic device in the aorta, presumably  a microcatheter, extending from the left carotid artery to the right iliac artery, the  proximal and distal aspects of the presumed microcatheter are not included in the scanning  range. This has been present since at least the time of the 8/21/2014 CT performed at  Little Company of Mary. Medicine Tests:  As above. Additional data collected:  1) Reviewed old records (type of record and content reviewed):  I reviewed prior consult notes, imaging, pathology    2) Obtained history from other than patient (indicate history and from whom):  Patient's wife re hpi    3)  Discussed with another health care provider (indicate what was discussed and with whom):  His case will be discussed at our multidisciplinary tumor board. 4)  Independent Visualization: CT imaging. Impression:  T1aN0M0 SCC of the R true vocal cord s/p RT (63 Gy in 28 fractions) with subsequent recurrence  and salvage total laryngectomy without neck dissection. Most recently with recurrence at stoma and left BOT (pT3Nx) s/p induction chemotherapy with Carboplatin, Taxol and Cetuximab. (completed on 9/29/2016) locally and then 5/5 cycles TFHX here  (completed on 12/16/16). Plan:  1) Recurrent laryngeal SCC - NED on scans from this week. Tracheostomy site appears well healed and he is functionally improving. - will continue surveillance scans every 4 months    2) Nutrition - Through G-tube with think liquids and soft foods PO per SpSw  - gaining weight, will continue current diet and f/u with SPSW as needed  - if continuing to do well, would refer to GI for consideration of dilation     4) Hydration - Appears hydrated today. 3) Hypothyroidism - elevated TSH today. Taking 50 mcg daily at home   - prescribed 25 mcg tab to take in addition (75 mcg total)   - has appointment with PCP in 4-6 weeks, recommended recheck    5) Anemia - remains anemic (normocytic). May be from hypothyroidism. No recent iron studies. - labs from 1/20, recommended to f/u with PCP for recheck with iron studies and after thyroid is corrected    6) Retained Hardware - appears to have happened at OSH. No evidence of migration or risk of such after discussing with radiology. - CTM    The patient's questions were answered to apparent satisfaction.

He was referred by Dr. Vokes who he follows for his history of SSCA of the larynx. He has been following closely with Dr. Vokes for routine f/u and was noted to have a mild anemia ranging between 9-10 in 2016. His hemoglobin at that time was 8.9. His repeat CT imaging in 7/17 showed multiple prominent thoracic and abdominal lymph nodes, particularly in the retroperitoneal space and these were no appreciably changed in his imaging in 11/29/17. On 11/29/17, he was seen in clinic and noted to have a hemoglobin of 7.1. In December 2017, he presented to an OSH for anemia and hemoglobin &lt;7 and was transfused 2 units of PRBCs. In his f/u visit with Dr. Vokes on 1/17/18, his hemoglobin was 6.6 and he denied any history of GI blood loss. Given his new onset anemia in the setting of his prominent lymph nodes, he underwent a bone marrow biopsy on 1/18/18. This evaluation was notable for a hypercellular bone marrow almost entirely replaced by a mature B-cell lymphoma with plasma cells differentiation with morphology consistent with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. He then underwent a repeat PET scan on 1/27/18 which revealed no hypermetabolic FDG avid tumor, though there were many enlarged. He presents today to discuss the diagnosis and treatment options. Since last seeing Dr. Vokes, overall he has been doing well. He is  accompanied by his wife who answers his questions, though he does participate with the use of a dry erase board. He complains of fatigue and is a little weak. He denies any recent bleeding complications. He has a persistent cough. He denies any new LAD, early satiety, abdominal distension, LE edema, change in bowel or bladder habits. He also denies any recent fevers, chills, drenching NS, neuropathy, localized weakness or numbness, skin rash, or HAs.

Results   HPV 16 DNA DETECTED     Interpretation   HPV 16 DNA is detected in this specimen. High-risk HPV is an etiologic agent of   many squamous cell carcinomas, including those of the oropharynx, uterine cervix   and anal canal. Evidence suggests that patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal   squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) have improved survival outcomes compared to   those with HPV-negative tumors (N Engl J Med 2010; 363:2435, J Natl Cancer Inst   2008; 100:2619). This test does not provide information about viral oncogene expression, and   cannot distinguish bystander HPV infections from integrated (potentially    oncogenic) HPV DNA. Correlation with p16 immunohistochemistry is recommended. IMAGING:  ~  PET WB H AND N INITIAL STAGE, 4/4/2018 11:02 AM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: 73 years old Male. Reason: Right tonsil mass with associated  lymphadenopathy. History: Right tonsil mass with associated lymphadenopathy. RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 10.9 mCi F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). BLOOD GLUCOSE (FASTING): 109 mg/dL. TECHNIQUE: After administration of the radiotracer and an uptake delay of 77 minutes,  nonenhanced CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with the PET  emission images. (The nonenhanced CT images were obtained solely for purposes of  completing the PET scan, are not of diagnostic quality and are thus not interpreted or  used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.) A series of overlapping PET  emission images was then obtained from the skull base to the proximal thighs. The average  SUV of the normal liver was 2.5 for this exam. COMPARISON: No previous PET here. Neck CT, 3/20/2018    FINDINGS: Today's CT portion grossly demonstrates enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck  level 2 region. Diffuse coronary calcifications are noted. Linear densities are seen in  the left lung base, consistent with atelectasis or scarring. Patient is status post  bilateral hip arthroplasty. Radiation seeds are noted in the prostate gland. Today's PET examination demonstrates a focus of increased activity in the right palatine  tonsil with SUV max of 14.7. Intense FDG uptake is seen in the enlarged lymph nodes in the  right neck level 2 region with SUV max of 9.1. There is decreased metabolic activity in  the center of the enlarged lymph nodes, suggesting central necrosis. No other evidence of FDG avid tumor. IMPRESSION:     1. Hypermetabolic lesion in the right palatine tonsil, consistent with the patient's  diagnosis of tonsillar cancer. 2. Hypermetabolic lymph nodes in the right neck at level 2 region with central necrosis,  consistent with the nodal metastasis. 3.

There  is no extension of the tumor into the tongue based, larynx, or masticator space. Report Electronically Signed: 4/29/2018 8:40 PM Daniel Ginat, MD  NARRATIVE:  MRI NECK SOFT TISSUE WWO, 4/4/2018 3:15 PM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: Right tonsil mass with associated lymphadenopathy. Right tonsil;  biopsy: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma. TECHNIQUE: MRI NECK SOFT TISSUE WWO. A total of 19 cc of Dotarem was administered  intravenously. FINDINGS: There is a right tonsillar mass that measures up to approximately 15 mm. There  is no extension of the tumor into the tongue based, larynx, or masticatory space. There is  cystic or necrotic right level 2A lymph node that measures 19 x 20 mm in axial section and  another cystic or necrotic right level 2B lymph node that measures 16 x 16 mm in axial  section. There is no other lymphadenopathy in the rest of the neck based on size criteria. There is a small left vallecular retention cyst or secretion. The thyroid and major  salivary glands are unremarkable. There is scattered mucosal thickening in the partly  imaged paranasal sinuses. The imaged portions of the intracranial structures and orbits  are unremarkable. There is multilevel degenerative cervical spondylosis. IMPRESSION:   1. A right tonsill mass is compatible with squamous cell carcinoma. Right level 2 lymphadenopathy is compatible with metastatic disease.

TECHNIQUE: After administration of the radiotracer and an uptake delay of 6 minutes,  nonenhanced CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with the PET  emission images. COMPARISON: PET/CT dated 4/4/2018    FINDINGS: Today's CT portion grossly demonstrates enlarged right cervical lymph nodes  similar to the prior exam. Coronary artery calcifications. Airspace opacities at the left  lung base consistent with atelectasis/scarring. Status post bilateral hip arthroplasties  with associated beam hardening artifact. Radiation seeds noted in the prostate. Today's PET examination demonstrates increased radiotracer uptake in a small subcentimeter  aortocaval lymph node attenuating greater than blood pool, suspicious for a site of active  disease with SUV max of 3.1. Diffuse radiotracer activity within the prostate could be  within normal limits however cannot rule out tumor in this area. The SUV max of the L4  vertebral body is 5.0. There is no increased radiotracer uptake within the enlarged right  cervical lymph nodes. IMPRESSION:  1. Increased radiotracer uptake in a subcentimeter aortocaval node, suspicious for a site  of active disease. Diffuse radiotracer activity within the prostate could be within normal limits however  cannot rule out tumor. 04/18/2018  DICTATED BY: Pu, Yonglin, M.D. EXAM(S): NM BONE SCAN WHOLE BODY 04/17/2018  4:24 PM     CLINICAL INFORMATION: 73-year-old man. Prostate cancer. Rising PSA. TECHNIQUE: 27.0 mCi Tc-99m MDP was injected intravenously. Standard delayed anterior and  posterior whole body and spot images were acquired. COMPARISON: None. FINDINGS: No abnormal osseous foci are identified to indicate metastatic disease. Symmetrically increased uptake in the cervical/thoracic/lumbar spine, shoulders, elbows,  wrists, MCP joints and knees is compatible with degenerative change. IMPRESSION: No evidence of bone metastases. CT UPPER ABD AND PELVIS W 4/17/2018 2:18 PM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: Male, 73 years old. Reason: prostate CA, hx of RT, rising PSA, eval  for dz History: as above.

Symmetric renal nephrograms without hydronephrosis. RETROPERITONEUM, LYMPH NODES: No significant abnormality noted. CALCIFICATIONS IN ABDOMINAL AORTA AND ITS BRANCHES: Moderate  BOWEL, MESENTERY: The large and small bowel are normal in caliber. Colonic diverticulosis  is present without specific evidence of acute diverticulitis. There is no  evidence of  bowel obstruction or pericolonic inflammation. There is no free intraperitoneal air. The  appendix is visualized and is normal in caliber without evidence of appendicitis. Small  fat-containing ventral hernia is present. BONES, SOFT TISSUES: Scattered small sclerotic foci noted in the vertebral bodies. Please  refer to same day nuclear medicine bone scan for further evaluation. OTHER: No significant abnormality noted  PELVIS:  Note that streak artifact from bilateral hip prostheses limits evaluation of adjacent  pelvic structures. PROSTATE, SEMINAL VESICLES: Radiation seeds are present within the prostate. BLADDER: No significant abnormality noted, although obscured by adjacent streak artifact. LYMPH NODES: Pelvic lymph node stations are obscured by streak artifact from adjacent hip  prostheses. BOWEL, MESENTERY: No significant abnormality noted  BONES, SOFT TISSUES: Bilateral hip prostheses are present. OTHER: No significant abnormality noted. Pelvic lymph nodes cannot be assessed secondary to streak artifact from adjacent hip  prostheses. Otherwise, no measurable disease within the abdomen or pelvis. Scattered small sclerotic foci in the vertebral bodies of uncertain clinical  significance. Please refer to separately reported nuclear medicine bone scan for further  characterization. ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTED:    1) Reviewed old records (type of record and content reviewed):  EPIC records    2) Obtained history from other than patient (indicate history and from whom):  Wife    3)  Discussed with another health care provider (indicate what was discussed and with whom):  Tanguy Seiwert MD      ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:    In summary, James Gardner is a 73Yrs male, with newly diagnosed HPV/p16+ right tonsil SCC, cT1 cN2b, also with history of recurrent prostate cancer. 1. Newly diagnosed HPV/p16+ right tonsil SCC, cT1 cN2b:     - Mr. Gardner is on the OPTIMA2 protocol for locally advanced disease (low risk arm). - Tolerating treatment well without concerns.

Evidence suggests that patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal    squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) have improved survival outcomes compared to   those with HPV-negative tumors (N Engl J Med 2010; 363:2435, J Natl Cancer Inst   2008; 100:2619). Intense FDG uptake is seen in the enlarged lymph nodes in the   right neck level 2 region with SUV max of 9.1. There is scattered mucosal thickening in the partly   imaged paranasal sinuses. The SUV max of the L4   vertebral body is 5.0. The gallbladder appears unremarkable  SPLEEN: No significant abnormality noted  PANCREAS: No significant abnormality noted  ADRENAL GLANDS: No significant abnormality noted  KIDNEYS, URETERS: Bilateral hypoattenuating lesions appear stable since  the prior study. ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTED:    1) Reviewed old records (type of record and content reviewed):  EPIC records    2) Obtained history from other than patient (indicate history and from whom):  Wife     3)  Discussed with another health care provider (indicate what was discussed and with whom):  Tanguy Seiwert MD      ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:    In summary, James Gardner is a 73Yrs male, with newly diagnosed HPV/p16+ right tonsil SCC, cT1 cN2b, also with history of recurrent prostate cancer.

History: Right tonsil mass with associated  lymphadenopathy. 04/04/2018       EXAM(S): MRI NECK SOFT TISSUE WWO 04/04/2018  4:36 PM   CC:PAZ-LANSBERG, MARIANELLA;  ADDENDUM:  FINDINGS: There is a right tonsillar mass that measures up to approximately 15 mm. 04/04/2018      PET PROSTATE IMAGING, 4/18/2018 3:25 PM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: Reason: as above History: prostate ca, hx of RT, eval for disease,  rising PSA     RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL: 9.16 mCi F-18 fluciclovine (Axumin). Small   fat-containing ventral hernia is present. CT CHEST W 6/15/2018 4:44 PM     CLINICAL INFORMATION: New tonsil CA status post chemotherapy evaluate for disease. TECHNIQUE: Contrast enhanced chest CT. 90 mL of Omnipaque 350 contrast material were  administered intravenously. Multiplanar reconstructions, including MIP, MINIP and Slab  images were reviewed. FINDINGS:     LUNGS AND PLEURA: Calcified nodules in the right lower lobe, statistically most likely  granulomas. Linear scarring and subsegmental atelectasis at the lung bases. No suspicious  pulmonary nodules or masses. MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: Thickening and dilatation of the lower two thirds of the esophagus  containing internal fluid, the esophageal lumen at the GE junction appears narrowed,   suspicious for stenosis, underlying mass cannot be excluded. Correlate with endoscopy. Calcified right hilar region lymph node. Normal heart size. No pericardial fluid. Aortic  annulus calcification. CORONARY ARTERY CALCIFICATION: Severe. CHEST WALL: Probable sebaceous cyst in the midline back. Sclerotic foci in the thoracic  and lumbar spine present previously but may be correlated with bone scan if of clinical  concern. UPPER ABDOMEN: Absence of enteric contrast material limits sensitivity for abdominal  pathology. Atherosclerotic calcification of aorta. IMPRESSION: No suspicious pulmonary nodules or masses. Thickening of the lower two thirds  of the thoracic esophagus with apparent narrowing of the lumen near the GE junction,  correlate with endoscopy to exclude stenosis or underlying neoplastic process. Stable  skeletal tiny sclerotic foci. SIGNED BY: Funaki, Alexandra N, D.O. DO 06/15/2018  DICTATED BY: Funaki, Alexandra N, D.O. DO 06/15/2018      MRI NECK SOFT TISSUE WWO, 6/15/2018 5:13 PM    HISTORY: Evolution for new tonsil ca, status post chemotherapy, eval for disease using  RECIST 1.1, compare to previous with measurements. TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar and multi-sequence MR images of the neck were obtained with and  without contrast, with intravenous administration of 19 cc Dotarem. FINDINGS: Previously seen necrotic right tonsillar mass is no longer discernible. Previously seen cystic/necrotic abnormal right level 2 lymph nodes appear to be decreased  in size when comparing to the prior exam dated 4/4/2018, for example the targeted right  level 2A lymph node measures 15 x 16 mm in axial sections, previously was 19 x 20 mm; the  targeted right level 2B lymph node measures 10 x 10 mm in axial sections, previously was  16 x 16 mm. No new additional abnormal lymph nodes by size criteria are noted in the neck. The nasopharynx and hypopharynx are unremarkable. Again seen is a small left vallecular T2  hyperintense focus consistent with retention cyst or secretions, unchanged. The larynx is  unremarkable. The upper trachea and esophagus are unremarkable. The contrast-enhanced  appearance of the submandibular, sublingual, and parotid glands bilaterally is  unremarkable. The thyroid gland is unremarkable. The oral tongue and the floor of mouth  are unremarkable. Scattered mucosal thickening in the partially visualized paranasal sinuses are again  noted, which appears to be slightly progressed in maxillary sinuses bilaterally. The  partially imaged brain structures and orbits are unremarkable. There are multilevel  spondylytic changes which is worse at C5-6 and C6-7 resulting in mild spinal canal  narrowing, unchanged. No focal worrisome bone marrow signal is noted. Previously seen right tonsillar mass is no longer discernible, which indicates  treatment response. Interval decrease in size of targeted cystic/necrotic abnormal right level 2 lymph  nodes, as detailed above. No new additional abnormal lymph nodes are noted in the rest of  the neck by size criteria. SIGNED BY: Yang, Carina W, M.D. 06/16/2018  DICTATED BY: Yang, Carina W, M.D. - 4/20/2018 - 6/15/2018:  Induction chemotherapy per the Optima 2 Trial with Carboplatin (AUC 5) on day 1, Nivolumab 360 mg on day 1 and Abraxane (100 mg/m2) on day 1, 8 and 15 every 3 weeks for 3 cycles.

This test does not provide information about viral oncogene expression, and    cannot distinguish bystander HPV infections from integrated (potentially   oncogenic) HPV DNA. IMPRESSION:      1. IMPRESSION:    1. Increased radiotracer uptake in a subcentimeter aortocaval node, suspicious for a site   of active disease. CALCIFICATIONS IN ABDOMINAL AORTA AND ITS BRANCHES: Moderate   BOWEL, MESENTERY: The large and small bowel are normal in caliber. FINDINGS:      LUNGS AND PLEURA: Calcified nodules in the right lower lobe, statistically most likely  granulomas. MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: Thickening and dilatation of the lower two thirds of the esophagus  containing internal fluid, the esophageal lumen at the GE junction appears narrowed,  suspicious for stenosis, underlying mass cannot be excluded. Previously seen cystic/necrotic abnormal right level 2 lymph nodes appear  to be decreased  in size when comparing to the prior exam dated 4/4/2018, for example the targeted right  level 2A lymph node measures 15 x 16 mm in axial sections, previously was 19 x 20 mm; the  targeted right level 2B lymph node measures 10 x 10 mm in axial sections, previously was  16 x 16 mm. ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTED:    1) Reviewed old records (type of record and content reviewed):  EPIC records    2) Obtained history from other than patient (indicate history and from whom):  Wife    3)  Discussed with another health care provider (indicate what was  discussed and with whom):  Tanguy Seiwert MD      ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS:    In summary, James Gardner is a 73Yrs male, with newly diagnosed HPV/p16+ right tonsil SCC, cT1 cN2b, also with history of recurrent prostate cancer. 7/8/2018 - 7/13/2018:  Cycle 2/3 of THF-X; tolerated well other than grade 1-2 neuropathy, grade 2 mucositis, grade 1 HFS and grade 2 radiation dermatitis.

Neck CT, 3/20/2018     FINDINGS: Today's CT portion grossly demonstrates enlarged lymph nodes in the left neck  level 2 region. There   is no extension of the tumor into the tongue based, larynx, or masticatory space. Airspace opacities at the left   lung base consistent with atelectasis/scarring. In addition, multiple coronal and   sagittal images were reconstructed from transaxial data. Thickening of the lower two thirds  of the thoracic esophagus with apparent narrowing of the lumen near the GE junction,   correlate with endoscopy to exclude stenosis or underlying neoplastic process. There are multilevel   spondylytic changes which is worse at C5-6 and C6-7 resulting in mild spinal canal  narrowing, unchanged. 7/22/2018 - 7/27/2018:  Cycle 3/3 of THF-X; tolerated well other than grade 1-2 neuropathy, grade 3 mucositis, grade 2 HFS and grade 2 radiation dermatitis. Taxol reduced to 75 mg/m2    - Today he is doing well; grade 3 mucositis with pain well controlled with Fentanyl/Norco/Moutwashes, grade 2 radiation dermatitis and grade 2 HFS well managed with moisturizers and Silvadene, and grade 1-2 neuropathy stable and without limitations. - Labs today without concerns. - Continue supportive care; return for MD visit for toxicity check on 8/6. - Plan for restaging CT Chest and MRI Neck in 4-6 weeks followed by adjuvant Nivolumab per protocol for 6 months (7 doses). Neuropathy:    - Grade 1-2 without limitations; dose reduction of Taxol to 75 mg/m2 with Cycle 2 and 3 of TFH-X. Mucositis:    - Grade 3; Fentanyl/Norco/Mouthwashes prn.

No suspicious   pulmonary nodules or masses. Previously seen cystic/necrotic abnormal right level 2 lymph nodes appear to be decreased  in size when comparing to the prior exam dated 4/4/2018, for example the targeted right  level 2A lymph node measures 15 x 16 mm in axial sections, previously was  19 x 20 mm; the  targeted right level 2B lymph node measures 10 x 10 mm in axial sections, previously was  16 x 16 mm. MRI NECK SOFT TISSUE WWO, 8/21/2018 3:30 PM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: Invasive right tonsil squamous cell carcinoma with lymphadenopathy  status post treatment. A total of 17 cc of Dotarem was administered  intravenously. FINDINGS: There are post-treatment findings in the neck without measurable tumor in the   oropharynx. There is interval decrease in size of the right level 2 lymphadenopathy,  measuring 10 x 10 mm in axial section, previously 15 x 16 mm. There is otherwise no  significant lymphadenopathy in neck based on size criteria. The larynx, thyroid, and major  salivary glands are unremarkable. There is scattered mucosal thickening in the imaged  paranasal sinuses. The imaged orbits are unremarkable. There are scattered areas of high  T2 signal in the cerebral white matter bilaterally. There is multilevel degenerative  cervical spondylosis. No measurable tumor in the oropharynx. Interval decrease in size of the right level 2 lymphadenopathy. Probable chronic small vessel ischemia in the imaged portions of the brain. CT CHEST W  8/21/2018 3:03 PM     CLINICAL INFORMATION: Male 73 years old Reason: new tonsil ca, s/p chemotherapy/RT,  evaluate for disease. TECHNIQUE:  Contrast enhanced chest CT.  90 mL of Omnipaque 350 contrast material were  administered intravenously. FINDINGS:     LUNGS AND PLEURA: New consolidative opacities in the medial segment of the right middle  lobe and the medial basal segment of the right lower lobe are associated with bronchial  wall thickening, suggestive of aspiration. No suspicious pulmonary nodule. The pleural  spaces are normal. There is mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening, but the central  airways are patent. MEDIASTINUM AND HILA: A left internal jugular central venous catheter has its tip at the  superior cavoatrial junction. Diffusely patulous esophagus which is filled with debris,  unchanged. Scattered mediastinal and benign morphology. No hilar lymphadenopathy. Atherosclerotic calcifications are present about the aortic arch. CHEST WALL: No suspicious osseous lesion identified. Bilateral axillary lymph nodes have  a benign morphology. Mild left-sided gynecomastia. Foci of hypoattenuation are present in both kidneys, most of which are compatible with  cysts. No evidence of metastatic disease in the thorax. Increasing stigmata of aspiration in the right middle and right lower lobes. Patulous, debris-filled esophagus puts the patient at risk of aspiration. Energy and weight stable. - Imaging 8/21 showed decrease in size of right level 2 lymphadenopathy and no measurable tumor in oropharynx and no thoracic metastases. - Return for MD visit with toxicity check on 8/30/18. - Will plan to start adjuvant Nivolumab per protocol for 6 months (7 doses) early September. - PSA 18.52 (8/21), monitor for now and will discuss if amenable to start ADT(likely Lupron alone without Abiraterone) on adjuvant Nivolumab per protocol. If agreeable, will repeat Axumin PET/CT prior to initiation for baseline. Constipation:     - Senna S 2 tab BID; Miralax prn.

Molecular Path, Solid Tumor HPV   Date Ordered:    4/9/2018    Status: Signed Out   Date Completed: 4/9/2018     Molecular Diagnostics Report        Clinical Information   Invasive squamous cell carcinoma, nonkeratinizing     Specimen Information   Specimen Source: Right tonsil, biopsy   Specimen Type: Formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue   Accession Number: S18-8554, Block A1      Pathology Assessment: The approximate tumor cell percentage in the tested area   of this specimen is 80%. PET H AND N RE-STAGE, 10/5/2018 1:06 PM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: Tonsillar cancer status post CRT and prostate cancer. 12 weeks  restaging scan. RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL:  11.0 mCi F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). BLOOD GLUCOSE (FASTING):  98 mg/dL. TECHNIQUE:  After administration of the radiotracer and an uptake delay of 105 minutes,  nonenhanced CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with the PET  emission images. (The nonenhanced CT images were obtained solely for purposes of  completing the PET scan, are not of diagnostic quality and are thus not  interpreted or  used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.) The average  SUV of the normal liver was 2.1 for this exam. COMPARISON: 9/20/2018     FINDINGS:  Today's CT portion grossly demonstrates a left chest port that terminates in  the superior vena cava. There is severe CAD or cardiac stents. There are metallic  densities in the anterior abdomen and pelvis that may be postsurgical. Bilateral hip  arthroplasties are noted. Today's PET examination demonstrates that the right base of tongue and cervical lymph  nodes that were previously hypermetabolic have resolved. There are 2 cutaneous foci in the  upper and lower thorax both just right of the midline which would be unusual for tumor and  are likely inflammatory. Would suggest direct examination of this area for further  evaluation. There are no other suspicious FDG avid lesions. IMPRESSION:  Resolution of prior hypermetabolic lesions at the base of tongue and cervical  lymph nodes without suspicious FDG avid lesion currently. SIGNED BY: Appelbaum, Daniel E, M.D. 10/05/2018  DICTATED BY: Appelbaum, Daniel E, M.D. CT NECK SOFT TISSUE W, 10/5/2018 10:30 AM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: Invasive right tonsil squamous cell carcinoma with lymphadenopathy  status post treatment. TECHNIQUE: CT NECK SOFT TISSUE W. A total of 65 cc of Omnipaque was administered  intravenously. COMPARISON: MRI NECK SOFT TISSUE WWO, 8/21/2018. There is interval decrease in size of a right level 2 lymph node, measuring 6  x 8 mm in axial section, previously 10 x 10 mm. There is no significant lymphadenopathy in  rest of the neck based on size criteria either. The larynx, thyroid, and major salivary   glands are unremarkable. There is scattered mucosal thickening in the imaged paranasal  sinuses. There is multilevel degenerative cervical  spondylosis. No residual significant lymphadenopathy in the neck. 10/05/2018  DICTATED BY: Ginat, Daniel T, M.D. 10/05/2018      PET PROSTATE IMAGING RESTAGING, 9/20/2018 3:07 PM    CLINICAL INFORMATION: 73-year-old male with prostate cancer, restaging. RADIOPHARMACEUTICAL:  9.3 mCi F-18 fluciclovine (Axumin). TECHNIQUE:  After administration of the radiotracer and an uptake delay of 3 minutes,  nonenhanced CT images were obtained for attenuation correction and for fusion with the PET  emission images. COMPARISON: PET/CT 4/18/2018    FINDINGS: Today's CT portion grossly demonstrates a central venous catheter with tip at  the superior caval atrial junction. Moderate atherosclerotic calcifications throughout the  thoracolumbar aorta and its branches, including severe atherosclerotic calcifications of  the coronary arteries. Mild diffuse esophageal thickening. Subcentimeter retroperitoneal  lymph nodes are present. Postsurgical changes of the abdomen and pelvis. Brachytherapy  seeds in the prostate gland. Components of bilateral hip arthroplasty devices produces  significant streak artifact limiting evaluation of the surrounding anatomy. Today's PET examination demonstrates somewhat irregularly increased activity throughout  the prostate gland, which is still fairly mildly fluciclovine avid,  although visually  appearing increased in extent and activity from the prior exam. Again seen are multiple very small, but somewhat fluciclovine avid lymph nodes involving  the aortocaval, retroperitoneal and right common iliac distribution. These are similar to  the prior exam, allowing for differences in technique, and are suspicious, although not  completely diagnostic of, regional lymph node metastases. Heterogeneous abnormal fluciclovine avidity throughout the prostate gland, progressed  from the prior exam, very suspicious for local tumor progression. Multiple subtle fluciclovine avid aortocaval, retroperitoneal and right common iliac  lymph nodes, again suspicious, but somewhat equivocal for, lymph node metastases. 09/20/2018  DICTATED BY: Appelbaum, Daniel E, M.D. MRI Neck with right tonsillar mass no longer seen and interval  decrease in level 2 adenopathy. Taxol reduced to 75 mg/m2    - Imaging 8/21 showed decrease in size of right level 2 lymphadenopathy and no measurable tumor in oropharynx and no thoracic metastases. - Initiated adjuvant Nivolumab every 4 weeks on 9/6. - PET/CT and CT Neck on 10/5 without concerns of recurrent disease; improved R cervical adenopathy. - Continue adjuvant Nivolumab with Cycle 2 of Nivolumab today; return on 11/5 for MD visit and Cycle 3 of Nivolumab. - Follow up with Dr. Agrawal (11/28) and Dr. Haraf (12/3). - Repeat imaging per protocol in 3 months with CT N/C/A/P (11/21). - Axumin PET/CT on 9/20 with concerns of local disease progression in the prostate and small volume abdominal/groin adenopathy; rising PSA at 28.29 (10/8) consistent with progression as well. - Discussed and recommend initiating ADT with Lupron; he is reluctant with concerns of toxicities especially decline in libido/sexual functioning and would like a second opinion (recommend Dr. Stadler at UofC or Dr. Hussain at NW). - Plan to obtain second opinion and rediscuss initiation of Lupron with C3 of Nivolumab. Neuropathy:    - Grade 1 without limitations secondary to Taxol; monitor for now. |2018-10-08:	BUN 14 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Anion Gap 14 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Creatinine 0.7 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	GFR Estimate (Calc) 111 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Carbon Dioxide 22 (L) 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Chloride 105 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Ser/Plasma 4.8 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Calcium 9.1 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Total 28.29 (H) 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Abs Eosinophils 0.50 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Hematocrit 36.8 (L) 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Hemoglobin 11.9 (L) 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	RBC 3.97 (L) 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Abs Basophils 0.03 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Neutrophils 64 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Abs Neutrophils 3.64 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Abs Lymphocytes 0.93 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	MCH 30.0 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Sodium 141 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Ser/Plasma 97 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	ALT (SGPT) 15 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	AST (SGOT) 22 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Serum 95 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Albumin 3.9 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Total Protein 6.6 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Total 0.2 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	--10/8/18: PSA 28. |2018-10-08:	MCHC 32.3 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	WBC 5.7 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	MCV 92.7 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Eosinophils 9 (H) 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Basophils 1 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Abs Monocytes 0.56 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Lymphocytes 16 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Monocytes 10 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Mean Platelet Volume 9.6 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	Platelet Count 216 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	RBC Dist Width 14.8 (H) 10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-08:	10/08/2018 0845. |2018-10-23:	James Gardner is a 73Yrs male here for consultation regarding prostate cancer.

(The nonenhanced CT images were obtained solely for purposes of  completing the PET scan, are not of diagnostic quality and are thus not interpreted or   used to diagnose disease independently of the PET images.) Right tonsil;   biopsy: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma. A series of overlapping PET   emission images was then obtained from the skull base to the proximal thighs. CT UPPER ABD AND PELVIS W 4/17/2018 2:18 PM     CLINICAL INFORMATION: Male, 73 years old. UPPER ABDOMEN: Absence of enteric contrast material limits sensitivity for abdominal   pathology. Scattered mucosal thickening in the partially visualized paranasal sinuses  are again  noted, which appears to be slightly progressed in maxillary sinuses bilaterally. CT CHEST W  8/21/2018 3:03 PM      CLINICAL INFORMATION: Male 73 years old Reason: new tonsil ca, s/p chemotherapy/RT,  evaluate for disease. The larynx, thyroid, and major salivary  glands are unremarkable. Subcentimeter retroperitoneal   lymph nodes are present. Today's PET examination demonstrates somewhat irregularly increased activity throughout  the prostate gland, which is still fairly mildly fluciclovine avid, although visually  appearing increased in extent and activity from the prior exam. - Continue adjuvant Nivolumab with Cycle 3 of Nivolumab today; return on 12/3 for MD visit and Cycle 4 of Nivolumab. - Repeat imaging per protocol in 3 months with CT N/C/A/P (1/2019).

Mr. Anderson first noticed R sided nonpainful swelling in neck, detected due to visible change. Presented to PCP in late August. A CT scan 8/16 a large (3.6cm) mass in the right neck with a necrotic core. An FNA biopsy of the mass showed moderately differentiated p16+ SCC, but the primary source was not clear at that time. Subsequent PET imaging 8/24 revealed hypermetabolic bilateral tonsils and associated right neck LN. The PET also showed faint uptake in the distal esophagus near the GE junction. He was referred to ENT, who performed a tonsillectomy and biopsy of other sites 9/28. Both tonsils had involvement of SCC, and both were p16+. The right tonsil contained a 0.9cm mass and the left a 0.15cm mass. Biopsies of the nasopharynx and base of tongue showed no involvement of SCC. Mr. Anderson then saw Dr. Ajay Bajaj (GI) 10/14 who visualized a small ulcer at G-E junction on EGD that appeared consistent with GERD; this was biopsied and the results are pending. Mr. Anderson's medical history includes a five-vessel CABG in 2003. Historically he has taken only atorvastatin and a baby aspirin.

He is able to function at work and with his children, but then he has to go to bed to recover from the effort and has trouble getting up again. Everything takes much more effort than it did before. His appetite is way down and he is not interested in food. He was able to take three doses of GCSF without bone pain, and he hasn't had nausea or vomiting lately. Denies fever, chills, headache but really struggling with mood. |2017-11-13:	Patient states that he has a little more energy today since his chemotherapy was delayed by a week last week--was able to spend a lot of time doing activities with his sons. He notes that the ativan helps him to feel a little more relaxed, but he does admit to constant anxiety. Doesn't have much of an appetite--notes that everything ""tastes like a big bite of butter"" but he tries to drink protein shakes when he doesn't feel like eating. He has stopped taking Miralax as his bowels have normalized and he's still going to work. He didn't take GCSF last week as he wasn't treated, and he is concerned his counts might still be low.

Patient states that he's having a hard time after his treatment last week. He notes that he did well over the weekend, but then he started to develop thick mucus which interfered with eating and sleeping and mouth pain. He notes that his sleep is interrupted because he frequently wakes up with a dry mouth and secretions in the back of his throat, so he's very tired. Eating is also difficult because his mouth hurts and it's hard to swallow past the mucus in his mouth--hasn't had much po in the last three days. He has been taking a little (around 10mgs a day) of oxycodone which helps for just a little while, and the mouth rinses don't seem to help at all. He vomited this morning but hasn't had nausea or vomiting otherwise. He denies sob, chest pain, fever, chills but does endorse fatigue and weakness. |2017-12-19:	/  HPI 53 y/o male with t1N3 BOT SCCA HPV+ on OPTIMA 2 admitted for cycle 2/3 TFHX |2017-12-20:	NO NEW INFORMATION|2017-12-21:	/  HPI 53 y/o male with T1N3 BOT SCCA HPV+ on OPTIMA 2 admitted for cycle 2/3 TFHX |2017-12-27:	HPI:  Robert Betlow is a 53Yrs male with BOT/Valleculae p16+ poorly differentiated SCC likely cT1N2a-N2bM0 s/p induction chemotherapy on the OPTIMA II trial who presents for follow up after cycle 2/3 of inpatient THFX. Patient states that he's really tired and having a lot of mouth pain which is interfering with his ability to eat. He is on a 12mcg fentanyl patch and taking 8 tabs of 5mg oxycodone throughout the day but it is still quite painful to swallow, so he's only been able to get down a little soup and some Boost over the last few days. He also notes that he hasn't had a bowel movement in over a week, which he thinks is from not eating very well. He has developed an irritating rash around his port site from the home care dressing which itches, but he has been getting IV fluids every day. Was able to take three doses of GCSF without bone pain. He has increased oral secretions for which he's using robitussin and his home suction machine, but the secretions wake him up throughout the night.

He's consuming mostly water, Boost, and soup which are quite painful to swallow--has to spend a lot of time just to get a little bit down. He's using mouth rinses and about 10-15mg of oxycodone q4h which brings his mucositis pain level down to a 4/10, but he feels that the sore area in his mouth is widening. He is really tired and occasionally dizzy, but he has been able to attend a few social/sporting events this week. Tolerated 3 doses of GCSF since discharge. He's working a few days a week from his home office. Having increased oral secretions--using robitussin and home suction machine with some relief. Continues to get 1 liter of fluid a day at home.

Patient notes that he's better than he was a week ago, but he's still feeling impatient that he has not healed faster. He is now working full-time from home--voice is hoarse from talking on the phone so much. He has been eating small portions of solid food--had one episode of vomiting a few days ago from eating an entire submarine sandwich at once.

Her taste is starting to disappear, but she continues to have a good appetite with good oral intake (weight is stable). She can eat solid foods (including meats and breads) without trouble, but she does note early satiety. She denies mouth sores or pain but does note the sensation of ""thickening"" in the back of her tongue.

She is taking 2 tabs of Norco q4-6h which takes the edge off the pain, but she's still fairly uncomfortable. She did try oxycodone but experienced several episodes of vomiting after which exacerbated her throat pain, so she doesn't want to try it again. She is only getting 1-2 smoothies down a day because it is so painful to swallow (even water burns her throat), but she continues to receive 2 liter of normal saline at home daily which helps. Dry oral mucosa is very irritating and painful. She also notes fatigue--hasn't been moving very far from the couch for the past few days. She has also developed erythema on her right neck for which she uses Radiaplex--hadn't developed dermatitis until she finished radiation. Mouth rinses help her mouth for a few moments, and she continues Miralax for a bowel regimen. She denies nausea, vomiting, chest pain, fever, or chills. Tired of feeling exhausted. |2018-02-19:	Patient notes that she just started feeling better yesterday when she was able to take a few bites of oatmeal and some canned fruit.

Continues on 2L of NS a day--still tired as she gets up to urinate frequently through the night. She has had three hard coughing episodes which resulted in vomiting--really hurt her throat. She is using mouth rinses and taking about 8 Norcos a day with fair pain control. Still has no taste and her interest in food is low. Bowels moving with the help of Miralax, and her energy remains pretty down. Feels weak overall, but thinks she's turning the corner. Denies chest pain, fever, nausea, shortness of breath, or chills. |2018-02-26:	Patient notes that she is extremely tired from urinating so often from the 2 liters of fluid a day that she is getting at home. She has to urinate every hour--during the day and at night--and she's so fatigued that she walked into a wall last night (did not fall or hit her head). She is able to eat a little bit more by mouth--had oatmeal, corn chowder, and Boost this week, but she still has little interest in food because her mouth is sore and food tastes strange. She also continue to get nightly coughing episodes--didn't have an episodes of vomiting this week--hasn't been taking robitussin because it burns her throat. Using 2 Norco tabs three times a day with meals along with mouth rinses--pain is manageable. She feels wobbly and unsteady in general and very tired, but she denies chest pain, fever, nausea, shortness of breath, or chills. Neck skin continues to heal well with the help of Radiaplex.

The bulk of her intake is still supplements as she still has no sense of taste. She is still receiving daily fluids--alternates 1000ml/day with 500ml/day, but she still has to urinate frequently no matter the dose. Still feeling wobbly and tired some days, but overall is feeling stronger. Her nightly coughing episodes are improved with extended-release guaifenesin--they still happen but not nearly as bad. Neck skin much improved--continues Radiaplex. |2018-05-15:	Patient is 76Yrs old female with T1N1 Base of Tongue SCC, p16+, who enrolled in OPTIMA2 now s/p 3 cycles of induction followed by 25 fractions of daily XRT (completed 2/9/18) .

Patient notes that he's doing well. His right neck fullness is still present and sometimes has mild pain in his right ear. Appetite and energy are good--no trouble chewing or swallowing. He continues to work full time and is independent of his ADLs. He denies sob, chest pain, fever, chills, nausea, or vomiting. Ready to start treatment. Oncology history  He first presented to his PCP with R neck swelling about 3 months ago, in the setting of a recent URI. Following resolution of the URI, though, the neck remained swollen and mildly tender, prompting consultation with a local otolaryngologist near his home in Portage, IN. FNA of the neck mass revealed metastatic SCC of unknown primary. CT scan in early June showed a cystic, multiloculated level II neck node, measuring 4x2.7cm. PET-CT shortly thereafter showed FDG-avid right tonsil and level II node. He was thus referred to UCMC, where he was seen by Dr. Gooi on 6/25 and underwent laryngoscopic exam that revealed a R tonsillar mass. Pathology was consistent with invasive, nonkeratinizing SCC; IHC was positive for HPV 16. |2018-07-25:	Mr. Robb is a 60 year-old male with p16 positive cT1N1M0 SCC of the right tonsil presenting today for follow up after C1D1 of induction therapy on the OPTIMA II protocol.

He denies associated pain, severe pruritus, presence of vesicles, fever, chills, sob, or body aches, and he hasn't had to take any medication for itching or pain. He did well after his first day of treatment last week--has been taking daily Zofran and Compazine for mild nausea. He has been unusually constipated for the last five days--has had to use bisacodyl and a rectal suppository to move his bowels, and his hemorrhoids have been subsequently irritated (using steroid cream with relief).

He also complains of a hemorrhoid flare-up for the last week from straining to pass a bowel movement--has been using Preparation H without relief. Continues Miralax daily and his bowel movements are now soft. He has been using about 4 Norco tabs a day for mouth pain along with lidocaine--pain is manageable to far.

He continues to eat a little solid food but mostly shakes--weight is stable. He is using 1 Norco tab about every 4 hours along with lidocaine rinses with good control of his pain. He's independent of ADLs, and he's doing his pt exercises daily--hasn't yet noticed a difference in his ankle pain. |2018-02-28:	He is now on cisplatin with daily xrt (now on sixth week of treatment). Subjective  Patient states that his mouth is starting to become more painful. He has switched from Norco to oxycodone (taking about 20-25mg today a day), but he still thinks that mouth rinses with lidocaine are superior at pain control. He notes that he had several BMs followed by an episode of diarrhea over the weekend--took a dose of Pepto-Bismol and imodium and now is constipated (plans to start daily Miralax tonight). Notes a 10-lb weight loss as his appetite is mostly gone and it hurts to eat--can still enjoy egg drop soup and just got a shipment of VHC Boost which he started this morning.

He notes that his pain is tolerable at rest, but chewing or swallowing is incredibly uncomfortable. He can no longer eat any solid foods--has only been drinking 3-4 VHC Boosts at home. He struggles to drink that supplement, however, because it worsens his oral secretions and swallowing so much of his secretions leads to mild nausea. He also notes discomfort around his right neck radiation site--has to tie his shirt back so it doesn't rub again his neck/shoulder. Bowels finally moved this weekend--plans to restart daily Miralax with the start of his fentanyl patch. Neuropathy is stable--function has not declined.

Bowels are much improved with the Miralax. Neuropathy a little better on 1200mg gabapentin a day--very little trouble with function. |2018-04-03:	Subjective  Patient notes he was hospitalized last week for AKI and has been receiving fluids daily since discharge--wants to stop as he thinks he can drink sufficient water now.

He has been taking 2L of NS IV daily until yesterday--has now stopped as he's confident he can drink a sufficient amount by mouth. His mouth pain has improved significantly--is taking 2 VHC Boosts daily and supplementing with rice, soup, and oatmeal. He does note that when he tries to eat too much at once, he vomits, so he's been eating small meals. Oral secretions also better--no longer feels like he's choking all the time. Continues to work daily, and his energy is slowing improving. He stopped gabapentin on his own--hasn't noticed any worsening in his neuropathy.

He remains on the fentanyl 25mcg patch and is taking Norco 2 tabs bid--pain is totally controlled when not eating.

Interval History:  Patient is very glad to be done with treatment, but he notes he's been struggling all weekend with fatigue and diarrhea. Patient states the dietician for GI Nutrition changed him from Osmolite to a combination of Osmolite and Glucerna for high blood sugars right before discharge, and since then he's had multiple episodes of diarrhea all day long (tested negative for c-diff in the hospital). Since he's so tired, he's had a few instances of not being able to make it to the toilet, and he's completely stopped using the Glucerna out of fear for further diarrhea. He has been able to swallow small sips of soup, and his mouth pain has been manageable on fentanyl 50mcg patch and two doses of dilaudid daily. He is taking robitussin for his increased oral secretions, and he continues frequent mouth rinses. He did take 3 doses of GCSF over the weekend without issue.

She is also taking Kefir and some softened cereal in water. She's taking IV fluids every other day, but she's not yet confident she can drink the equivalent so doesn't want to stop.

He's had a headache since before his cancer diagnosis, but he's noticed that it has quieted a little bit in the last week. He also thinks his right neck mass continues to slowly shrink as well with treatment--little easier to swallow now. His nausea is contained on tid Zofran and compazine, and he's eating well and often. He has right hip pain from known arthritis for which he's going to get a cortisone shot on 4/4--has felt very restless from hip pain (difficult to get comfortable when sleeping).

He was seen by a doctor and prescribed a short course of antibiotics without improvement. He then noted swelling in the left neck, starting in July, and so sought medical attention from a local ENT. He was given another course of antibiotics, without improvement, and so a CT was ordered in August. This revealed suspicious lymph nodes left cervical lymph nodes, I nthe level IIa, III, and V chains, as well as a level Vb supraclavicular lymph node. FNA on 8/16 revealed SCC, p16 and p63+. Subsequent PET-CT on 8/21 revealed likely left BOT primary lesion extending from inferiorly to the epiglottis and superiorly to the palatine tonsil. The nodes on prior CT (left IIA, IIB, III, IV, VB, and right IIA and IIB/III were all noted to be hypermetabolic. Finally, there were multiple subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, too small to characterize, but one did show mild FDG-uptake. He is referred to Dr. Pearson's clinic for discussion of chemo as part of combined modality chemo/RT treatment. Oncology History:  1.
